ΟΝ THE STYLE OF ST. JAMEs cxcix

13 πορευσόμεθα εἰς τήνδε τὴν πόλιν καὶ ποιήσομεν
ἐκεῖ ἐνιαυτὸν καὶ ἐμπορευσόμεθα καὶ κερδήσομεν. The
frequency of these parallels in St. James does not require us to
suppose that he had been trained in the use of their figures of 1
speech by the Greek rhetoricians, but is probably to be traced
to his familiarity with Hebrew poetry, which is founded on the
principle of parallelism.¹

Asyndeton: sl, ., (ί

This figule is most commonly used in en‘Qeration (1) and
φξβ-(2). Of the fonner we have examples in 111. 15 οὐκ
ἔστιν αὕτη ἡ σοφία ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη, ἀλλὰ e'7rcryetos·‚ ψ υ χ ι κ ή,
δ α ι μ ο ν ι ὠ δ η ς, and 17 ἡὴ ἄνωθεν σοφια πρῶτον μὲν ἁγνή ἐστιν,

εἰς τὸ λαλῆσαι, ,Β ρ α δ ὑ ς εἰς ὀργὴν, Vssfi κατεδικάσατῖἶφ ο ν ε ύ-
σ α τ ε τὸν δίκαιον. Of the latter we have an example in the
verse last quoted, ε’ ονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον being followed by οὐκ
ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν, where it would have been more usual to

insert ὁ δέ before οὐκ, also in i. 19 ταχὺς εἰς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι, βρα-

σαντι ἔλεος· κ α τ α κ α υ χ ἃ τ α ι ἔλεος κρίσεως, where again we
might have expected τὸ δὲ ἕλεος κατακαυχᾶται. But the writer
also uses asyndeton to express a result, iv, 2 οὐκ ἔχετε· φονεύετε (01
φθονεῖτε if that is the true reading)...01'1 δυνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν·
μάχεσθε.

iii. 1—12, iv. 6-10, v. 1-6, are analysed as specimens of parallelism.
