clxii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

δια, is pure religion‚' cf. Acts ix. 15 σκεῦος ε’κλογῆς ἐστί μοι
οὗτος, John i. 15) αὕτη ἐστὶν ῆ μαρτυρία Ἰωάννου. We have
exalnples of oblique predication in i. 27 ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν,
ν. 10 ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε τῆς κακοπαθίας τοὺς προφήτας, and
ii. 5 οὐχ ὁ Θεὸς ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ πλουσίους
ἐν πίστει; ‘has not God chosen the poor to the world (to be)
rich in faith2’ The article however may be used with the
predicative noun when it does not denote a class in which the sub-
ject is included, but a concept of equa] extension with which it is
deolared to be identical, as iii. 6 ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ γλῶσσα
καθίσταται ‘ the tonguo is (represents) the unrighteous world.'

The English possessive pronoun is expressed in Classical Greek
by the article alone, except for the sake of clearness or emphasis.
So too oceasionally in the N.T., ομ. Matt. xxvii. 24 ἀπενίψατο
τὰς χεῖρας, Luke v. 13 ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα, James ii. 15 λειπόμενοι
τῆς ἐφημέρου τροφῆς ί111 lack of their daily food' [or perhaps
‘ the day's food'], ii. 14 ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ,
μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν,· ‘can his saith save him2’
[But perhaps it is better to take the article simply as referring· to
the previous πίστις, ‘cau the saith (spoken of) save him ' ?], v, 16
ἐξομολογεῖσθε ἀλλήλοις τὰς ἁμαρτίας ‘confess your sins to each
othe1·‚' or perhaps ‘confess the sins (spoken of in v. 15) '. The
latter however seems here less appropriate, as the sins spoken ofin
v. 15 were those of the sick man alone.

Generally however in the N.T. the genitive of the demonstrative
or persona] pronoun is added, eff. i. ‘21 τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν, ii. ὃ τὸν πλη-
σιόν σου, ii. 18 τὴν πίστιν σου., τῶν ἔργων μου, iii. (5 τοῖς μέλεσιν
ὑμῶν, 1. 8 ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, i. 10 τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ...τῇ ταπεινώσει
αὐτοῦ, i. 11 τὸ ι’ἷνθος αὐτοῦ...τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ...ἐν ταῖς
πορείαις αὐτοῦ. Where two nouns are joined the genitive of the
pronoun may be stated only once, eff. iii. 13 δειξάτω ἐκ τῆς καλῆς
ἀναστροφῆς (αὐτοῦ) τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, iv. 9 ὁ γέλως ὑμῶν εἰς πένθος
μεταστραφήτω καὶ ἡ χαρὰ (ὑμῶν) εἰς κατήφειαν, ii. 18 δείξω ἐκ
τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν (μου).

Occasionally the article is omitted, and the possessive p10-
noun alone employed, as in i. 26 μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν
ἑαυτοῦ αλλ’ ἀπατῶν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ, ii. 2 εἰς συναγωγὴν
ὑμῶν if we tianslate ‘into your synagogue' instead of‘ into a
synagoo· ue (01 ‘meeting ²) of youls‚' v. 20 ὁ ἐπιστρέψας αμαρ-
