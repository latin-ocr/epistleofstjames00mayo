IV 1—17 MAKING PLANS 215

while we are no doubt justified in· believing that Christ's grace will
be sufficient for us in whatever difficulties, still it is our duty to use all
our powers, especially our nobler powers, in God’s service, that the
powers of imagination, hope, and reason, were given to us especially as
guides to action 3 and that no great and permanent work has ever been
effected in which these powers were not fully exereised.

It is probably this passage which has given rise to the common use
of the letters D.V., as to which see the note. It is a comparatively
trivial example of what may be called the objectification of ideas,

which in greater matters has been productive of so much evil in regard „s

to religion. To have acquired the habit of submission and resignation '
to the Divine Will is all-important for man : but the use of the symbol
is a matter of indifference. &Vbere it is used in one place and omitted
in another, it would rather seem to imply that, when omitted in writing,
it was not present in the mind.

Another form of worldlincss is the love os maleth, whether stored
ty the miser, or sqaandered hys the ‘colitptuarffi The deeccy which
threatens nnnscd iccalth is itself symbolical of thc destruction
awaitiny its selfish possessor. The cry of the lahonrer, from whom
his jast ‘zcce‘qes are withheld, is not nnheard in heaven. As sor
the voluptuary who, in this final crisis of his conntrgy's for-
tnnes, thinh‘s of nothing) hat personat gratification, he can only bc
compared to a sheep fattened for slauyhtmn By the help of an nnjnst
law hc may yet rid of the ‘ecnrcsistiny riqhteons, whose life is a con-
tinual witness atqainst him ,· bnt Zet him remcmher that the Lord is
cominq to jndyment. Let the brethren, on their side, wait patiently
and strcnqthen their hcarts to endnrc for the short period which has
still to clapse before the comino of the Lord. Lat them taho a lcsson
from the husbandmen who paticntly rectit sor the rains to mature the
sufflans of the earth, and from the prophets of old 'who spohe and suffered
in the name of the Lord. The story of Job is a strihiny example of
the blessiny which awaits patient endnrancc. It shows ‘as that, how-
ever serere mags bc the trial to which the helicver is exposed, God’s
merops and lovinyhindncss will be made manifest in the end. The
brethwn, however, rnnst remember that the Lord eomes not only to tahe

os a mmmuriny, unforyiving] spirit.
