II 7, 8 NOTES 83

δὲ λάβῃ τὴν σφραγῖδα (baptism) ἀποτίθεται τὴν νέκρωσιν καὶ ἀναλαμβάνει
τὴν ζωήν, Justin M. Apol. i. p. 94 D (in baptism) ἐπονομάζεται τῷ
ἑλομένῳ ἄναγεννῆθηναι...τὸ τοῦ Πατρὸς τῶν ὅλων ὄνομα. Τ110 latter ex-
planation seems the better, both as more suited to the phrase, which
seems to imply an actual invocation of the name of Christ over each ’
individual believer 3 and also because Christians were known to each
other by such names as ἀδελφοί and πιστοί, while Χριστιανοί, like
Ναζωραῖοι and Γαλιλαῖοι, was at first used by outsiders as a name of
re roach.

ἓ. This respect for the rich may however (μέντοι 111 its ordinary sense)
proceed from a good motive 3 it may be you are filled with the spirit of
love, ready to forgive injury and to do to others as you would have
them do to you. If so, well and good. But if your conduct is really
determined by worldly motives, if you treat the rich well simply because
he is rich and you wish to gain favour with him, and treat the poor
harshly because he cannot advance your interests, then you break the
law which forbids respect of persons and enjoins special consideration
for the poor. It will not do for you to plead that you are scrupulous
in other duties. The law is a whole3 it is the revelation of God's will :
disregard to a single point is disregard to the Lawgiver3 it is dis-
obedience to God, and the spirit of disobedience breaks the law as a
whole. Do not entertain any idea of keeping this or that particular
precept and obtaining credit by that means. Such views belong to the
slavish conception of law as a collection of unconnected rules bearing
on outward conduct alone. The Christian law is a law of liberty3 it
is the free manifestation in outward act of the loving spirit within.
We shall be judged not by the observance or neglect of this or that
external rule, but by the degree in which our heart and life has been
penetrated by the spirit of love. If we show kindness, consideration,
compassion in our behaviour to other men, we shall meet the same in
God’s judgment of us.

νόμον τελεῖτε βασιλικόν.] Middleton (p. 423) thinks the absence Of the
article forbids the translation ‘the royal law.' I do not understand
what he means by the words, ’βασιλικός Ι interpret excellent, in which
case the article is unnecessary.' We have no right to tone down the
remarkable word βασιλικός, and even if we were at liberty to do so it
makes very poor sense to say ‘ ye fulfil an excellent laW.' Hofmann and
Schegg however agree with M. : the latter says ‘ νόμον 011110 Artikel, weil
Jakobus nicht das Gesetz der Nachstenliebe meint, sondern ein spezi-
elles Gebot das aus dem N 'achstenliebe hervorgeht (viz. “ Seeleneifer‚’'
the J ewish love of proselytizing‚ as he explains above) und so erhaben
ist dass es ein konigliches genannt zu werden verdient.' Such an inter-
pretation needs no refutation, but it is strange that neither 111711101- nor
Buttmann has referred to this passage in (liscussing the use of the
article in the NT. There is no difficulty in the anai-throus νόμος being
used (as below iv. ll) for the law of Christ or of Moses 011 the same
principle that βασιλεύς could be used for the king of Persia, but the
addition of an anarthrous epithet should not have been passed over
without comment, as it has been by the editors generally. The only
