214 COMMENT

not call us to it, for the sake of showing off our acuteness and pulling
down others by way of exalting ourselves. Even where it is our duty
to judge, it should bo done under a sense of responsibility, with the
consciousness of our own liability to go wrong and a genuine desire for
the improvement, not the humiliation, of the person blamed 3 and
further our judgment should be dctermined by the objectivc standard
of right, not by our private tastes or likings ; otherwise we set up our-
selves above the law and the lawgiver. There is no fault which brings
about its own punishment 111016 certainly than the love of fault-finding.
While we become quick to see the mote in a brother’s eye, the beam is
still growing in our own. The habit of negative criticism is destruc-
tive to the creative faculty aud to much besides. All human action is
inore or less blundering 3 if we choose to concentrate our attention on
the blunders, and shut our eyes to the honest aim and the real good
effected in spite of the blunders, we lose the stimulus of admiration
and emulation3 thus deadening within 05 all that makes life worth
living, if it be true, as the poet teaches, that ‘ we live 'by admiration,
hope, and love.²

MARING PLANS.

Are we then to live at hap-hazard‘ss not to use our best endeavours
to for-esee the future and shape our actions in accordance with proba-
bilities2 This would be to give up one main 056 of reason. When our
Lord said ‘take no thought (RV. ‘be not anxious') for the 01011011,
for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself ’ (Matt. vi.
34), he did not mean to forbid serious consideration of the course to
be adopted under given circumstances. He did not mean that it
was wrong to make engagements beforehand and to take steps to
keep our engagements3 that it was wrong for a man to deliberate
carefully before choosing a profession or accepting a post which
might be offered him3 or again, that it was wrong for a states-
nian to consider carefully what mensures he should bring foi-ward
in Parliament. His meaning was that we should not worry our-
selves with 1116 anticipation of evil: wc should make all due prc-
paration for it, and then await it calmly in reliance upon God.

x '⁷ As Christ forbade undue anxiety, so St. -James here forbids undue

“ conlidence. We should bear in mind that we cannot foresee the issues
of things3 so that what we think desii-able now, may turn out here—
after to have been undesirable3 aud again that the best-laid plans
are liahle to fail; so that, however good the object, still it may be
unattainablc by us ; that we should therefore not stake our life, as it
were, on a single throw of the dice, but join with all our plans for the
future the reservation ‘if (J‘od will‚' and the aspiration ‘ Thy will be
l· ‹lone.' Some people, perhaps thinking of Christ's promise of divine assist-
ance to those who should be brought before synagogues and magistrates
for his sakefflatt. Χ. 18), seem to have an idea that forethought and plan-
ning are in themselves opposed to faith, and that, in religious matters
especially, there is something approaching to impiety 111 making pre-
parations for the future. lt is enough to say in answer to this, that
