exliv THE EPISTLE OF ST. J AMEs

Hermas ' (p. 868). As examples he gives J ames iv. 7, ‘ Resist the
devil and he will fiee from you,' compared with Mami. xii. 5
(abrhlged), where Hermas says ‘ Man desires to keep the commands
os God, but the devil is strong and overcomes him! The angel
answers, ‘The ‹levil cannot overcomc the servants of God who place
their hope entirely in Him. If you resist him he will bc
vanquished and flee away.’ On this it may be observed (1) that
the saying occurs in three other passages of Hermas (Mena. vii. 2,
xii. 2, 4), and that it also occurs thrice in what is probably a much
earlier treatise‚ the Testamcnts (gf the Twelve Pato⁷iao·‹·l1s; (2) that
every text quoted by a preacher is naturally imbedded in a suitable
context, if the preacher knows his business; (3) that St. J ames's style
is confessedly condensed and aphoristic, but this is no evidence of
latcnesS, rather the contrary 3 (4), that, as has been shown above in
answer to Briickner, the saying is quite in its place in our Epistle.
His other examples are J ames iii. 15 (the eontrast of earthly and
heavenly wisdom) compared with Maud. xi„ James i. 27 (on true
religion) compared with Mami. viii„ J ames i. 20 (‘ the wrath of man
worketh not the righteousness of God ') compared with stlaml. v.‚ a
passage which would have been more appropriately compared with
James iv. 5. As to all these examples Ι 0111 confident that every
unprejudiced reader who takes the trouble to examine them, will
agree with me, that it would bc as reasonable to say that any
modern sermon is older than its text, as to say that these comments
are older than the parallels in St. James. There is not even any
marked abruptness in the original context to excuse such extra-
ordinary perversity of judgment. And then the fatuity of ima·
gining that a man of such strong individuality, whose every
word attests his profound and unshakeable 0011ν10110115, could
condescend to borrow from one so immeasurably his inferior,
whose thoughts show about an equal mixture os cleverness and
silliness‚ and whose language, as Dr. Taylor has proved, is little
more than a patchwork of old materials, new furbished to avoid
detection 1

As regards Pfleidercr's attempt to prove the lateness of our
Epistle from the absence of patristic evidence in its favour, I ’
