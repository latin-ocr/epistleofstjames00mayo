more exact and appropriate in the former than in the latter. For instance the
exhortation to rejoice in tribulation 15 common to both ; but in Peter we see
that there is real occasion sor it—those whom 110 addresses are actually in the
midst of a fiery trial, suffering sor righteousness' sake (iii. 14, iv. 12); this per-
secution is the work of the devil whom they resist by their patient endurance
(v. 8, 9) 3 they are bidden to exult, not in their trial itself, but 111 the glory
which is to follow, the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time (i. 5, iv.
13) ; they are eneouraged hythe reininder of their high calling (i. 3, ii. 9, 20,
21, 111. 14, &e.), by the example of Christ whose suss'erings they share (ii. 21, iii.
18, iv. 13), and by the hope of the promised reward (i. 4, 7). The tone of the
epistle is throughout that of hopesulnuss, and the exultant joy in tribulation
is only the issue and climax of this hopefulness. In James it is just the
reverse : he borrows the phrase ‘ manisold temptations,’ but there is no special
appropriateness in it ; those whom he addresses are not suffering persecution
from the hcathen: so too he borrows the phrase ‘resist the devil,' but this
15 1101 connected with the general thought os trial3 he bids them rejoiee in
tribulation, buthe gives no reason foi· their doing so; hc has not prepared
the way for it by the spirit—stirring appeals and encouragements of Peter 3 if
ge gefers to the future it 15 only to remind them of the terrible coming of the
u ge.

Now to examine this: could any one imagine from Bruekner's
description that St. James grounds his exhortation to rejoice‚ on
the fact that trial works endnranee, and endurance Christian
perfeetion (i. 2—4) 2 could he imagine that it is J ames who says,
he who endures trial will receive the erown of life, the kingdom
promised to all that love God (i. 12, ii. 5) 2 that it 1511011105 who
speaks of the profession of Christianity as in itself a patent of
nobility (i. 9), and refers to the fact of Christ's being the glory of
Christians as annihilating all earthly distinctions (ii. 1) ’ἐ It is no
doubt true that he puts in the fore—front of his Epistle the high-
toned, uncompromising summons to rise superior to human ¹
weakness, and rejoice in what the world thinks misery. I have :
elsewhere spoken of this as an instance of the stoicism of St.
James, and pointed out how the 501110 demand is sostened down
by the gentlcr and more sympathetie Apostle. But it is not more
stoical than it is Christ-like: it is 0 reminisccnce, like 50 much
besides, of the actual words of his divine Brother, ‘ Blessed are ye
that weep now; blessed are ye when nien shall hate you, and
separate you from their company, and cast out your name as evil
for the Son of man's sake ; rejoiee ye 111 11101 day and leap for joy.'
If Christ did not shrink from this sublime paradOX, if paradox was
one os the most efficient weapons used by Him as well as by older
reformers, by Socrates and the 810105, 10 shake men out of their
slumbers and reuse them to aim at a new and higher ideal, why
