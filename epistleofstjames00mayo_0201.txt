' ΘΝ THE GRAMMAR oF sT. JAMEs clxxvii

Of action, as i. 14 πειράζεται ὑπὸ τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ἐξελκόμενος Λαὶ
δελεαζόμενος, v. 1 κλαύσατε ὀλολύζοντες, ν. 7 ἐκδέχεται τὸν καρ-
πὸν μακροθυμῶν; or by introducing some new consideration, which
may be causal‚ as i. 2 πᾶσαν χαριὶν ἡγήσασθε γινώσκοντες κ.τ.λ.,
iii. 1 μὴ γίνεσθε διδάσκαλοι εἰδότες κ.τ.λ.; or concessive, as iii. 3
τὰ πλοῖα τηλικαῦτα ὄντα καὶ ὑπὸ ἀνέμων σκληρῶν ἐλαυι όμενα μετά·
γεται (‘ though so great’); or may describe the circumstances under
which the action takes place, as i. 13 μηδεὶς πειραζόμενος λεγέτω
i. 26 εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν ἀλλ’
ἀπατῶν καρδίαν; or even denote the consequence, as ii. 9 ἁμαρτίαν
ἐργάζεσθε ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμον, i. 22 μὴ γίνεσθε ἀκροαταὶ
μόνον παραλογιζόμενοι ἑαυτούς (‘ ye commit sin and are convicted,'
‘ be not hearers only and thus deceive yourselves ').

Aorist expresses priority of time, eg. i. 12 δόκιμος γενόμενος·
λήμψεται τὸν στέφανον (‘ after being tried'), i. 15 ἡ ἐπιθυμιά συλ-
λαβοῦσα τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν, ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα ἀποκυεῖ
θάνατον <ί when it has conceived,’ ‘when it has come to maturity');
when joined with an imperative the aorist denotes that the action
expressed by it must be done before the action expressed by the
imperative, eg. i. 21 ἀποθέμενοι ῥυπαρίαν δέξασθε τὸν λόγον (‘ lay
aside filthiness and receive the word '), v, 14 προσευξάσθωσαν
ἀλείψαντες (‘let them anoint and pray'). The prior action may
be the cause of what follows, eg. i. 18 βουληθεὶς ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς.
It may also explain a preceding adverbial phrase, eg. ii. 21 ἐξ
ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαάκ, ii. 25 ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ὑπο-
δεξαμένη τοὺς ἀγγέλους.

Persae& only found in the periphrastic subjunctive v. 15 ᾗ
πεποιηκώς.

Ιτίιΰῑινο does not occur. Instead we have the periphrastic μέλ-
λων κρίνεσθαι ii. 12.

(b) With article.

Preme as attributive adjective i. 5 παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ
πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς, i. 21, ii. 3, iii. 6, iv. 1, v. 13 as substantive iii. 4
ὅπου ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντος βούλεται, v. 15 ἡ εὐχὴ σώσει τὸν κάμ-
νοντα, i. 6, 12, ii. 3, 5, iii. 18, iv, 11, 12. Often the reference is
not confined to present time, but is equally applicable to past and
future, as in the examples quoted.
