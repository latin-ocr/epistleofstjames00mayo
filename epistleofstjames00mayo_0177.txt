ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GRAMMAR OF ST. J AMES cliii

According to Meisterhans, Gr. d. Act. [mehr. p. 141, νγίὙνομαι 15 the
reading of the Attic inscriptions without exception up to 292 B.C.‚
and «γίνομαι, equally without exception, between 290 and 30 B.C,

Vowels.

ι for ει in abstract substantives: see Hort bc. p. 153, and
compare ἐριθία(’.ἶ) James iii. 16, ἀλαζονίαις 1ν. 16, κακοπαθίας
V. 10; but περισσείαν i. 21, θρησκεία i. 27 (ἐθελοθρησκιά
Col. ii. 23).

πρόϊμος for πρώιμος (v, 7), for which Hort compares χρεοφειλέ-
της, Στοῑκός.

πραΰτης for the classical πραότης i. 21; the forms πραΰς and
πρᾶος are both Classical, the former being preferred in the feminine

and generally in the oblique cases.

Hiatus.

Hiatus is not shunned by the Hellenistic, as it is by the later
Attio writers. Thus in i. 4 it occurs six times3 and elision is pro-
portionably rare, the only words elided in our Epistle being ἀλλά
in ii. 18 ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις (but ἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν 1. 26, ἀλλὰ ἐπίγειος
iii. 15), ἐπί in ii. 7 ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, V. ’7 ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, and v. 14 ἐπ’ αὐτόν;
ἀπό in ἀφ’ ὑμῶν iV. 7, V. 53 παρά sn παρ’ ᾧ 1. 17; κατά in καθ’
ἑαυτήν 11. 17, καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν 111. 9, κατ’ ἀλλήλων V. 9. On the
other hand we have ὑπό unelided in iii. 4 ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστους in fact
the only word which is uniformly elided in the ΘΤ. 15 παρά,
but the word 15 comparatively rare, and does not occur before a
proper name beginning with a vowel. Of unelided κατά we find
instances in Acts iii. 17 κατὰ ἄγνοιαν, ib. xxii. 3 κατὰ ἀκρίβειαν,
Rom. ii. 2 κατὰ ἀλήθειαν, ib. iii. 5, 1 Cor. iii. 3, 1Χ. 8, XV. 32 κατὰ
ἄνθρωπον, Rom. xiv, 15 κατὰ ἀνγάπην διο. Unelided ἐπί 15 found
in Luke iii. 2 ἐπὶ Ἰωάννην, ib. v. 36 ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον, ι’ἷ). xi. 17 ἐπὶ οἶκον,
ih. xxi. 10 ἐπὶ ἔθνος &e ; unelided ἀπό in Luke viii. 43 ἀπὸ ἐτῶν,
ib. xiii. 21 ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, ib. xvi. 18 ἀπὸ ἀνδρός; unelided ὑπό in
Luke vii. 27 ὑπὸ ἀνέμου, z'b. xxi. 24 ὑπὸ ἐθνῶν &e Unelided διά
15 found in Heb. v, 14 διὰ ἕξιν, 2 Cor. V. 7 διὰ εἴδους and before
proper names, In general we may say that elision takes place
before a pronoun or word with which the proposition is habitually

joined, but not before a proper name or a word which it is
important to make distinct.
