ΙΙΙ 13-18 USE AND ABUSE OF SPEEOH 207

as an organ of speech, are entirely psychological 3 but they constitute
an easily recognized department of man’s activity, which St. James
tickets by this name, and besides, like the pleasures of the palate,
they seem to havea separate life of their own, independent of our
will, so that we often find it the hardest thing in the world to hold
our tongue (ver. 8). The next point which we might be disposed to
question is the statement that one who controls the tongue is a
perfect man ς that, as the movement of the horse is governed by the bit,
so the activity of man is governed by his use of the tongue. Perhaps
we may find this easier to understand if we go back to the analysis of
temptation given in i. 14. Man's own lust is the cause of sin. The
angry or impure or impious thought goes on to express itself, first in
words, and then in actlon. Under the Old Dispensation it was wrong
action, which was forbidden by the Ten Commandments. St. J ames,
like his Master, bids us stop the evil current at an earlier point. Not
only he that kills is in danger of the judgment, but he that says ‘ Raca '
or ‘ Thou fool.' Evil is to be met and conquered in its initial stage of
thought, before the bitter 01² malicious feeling has had time to vent
itself in words. It may be objected that there are cases in which
some such vent is needed for the raging passion within, which only
becomes more dangerous by the endeavour to stifle it, just as grief
when it is unable to find relief in tears. Allowing this to be the case,
it need not, in the first place, diminish the value of the general rule
that we should accustom ourselves to check the evil impulse in the
bud 3 and, secondly, we have to remember that, in St. James' view,
prayer is the natural vent for all the agitations of a Christian (below
v. 15). Perhaps however we may conclude from the language used
here and above (i. 19) that St. James was addressing people more
prone than the English to give expression to their feelings in words,
people of more fiery and less phlegmatic temperS.

We are not of course to suppose that St J ames denies or ignores the
right uses of the tongue. The very importance he attaches to hearing
proves the value he puts on the right kind of speaking, and the
description he gives just below of the qualifications of the truly wisa
teacher is worthy to be compared with St. Paul’s panegyric on
Charity.
