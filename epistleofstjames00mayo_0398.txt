138 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἀδελφοί] The three-feld repetition of the word n this sentence is in
part required by the different constructions of καταλαλῶ and κρίνω, like
the fourfold repetition of νόμος, but it also adds weight to the writer's
appeal to their feeling of brotherhood. The appeal is heightened in
the third case by the addition of τὸν ἀδ. αὐτοῦ, not simply α, but lais,
brother.

καταλαλεῖ νόμου καὶ κρίνει νόμον] Whoever deliberately breaks a law
and does not repent of it, thereby speaks against it and treats it as a
bad law, since it is the 03301100 01 a law to require obedience, and he
who refuses obedience virtually says it ought not to be law. Thus 110 who
speaks against a brother virtually speaks against the law of brotherhood.
The law which the writer has in mind is the royal law spoken of in ii.
8, to which reference is made by the word πλησίον in V. 12. The
offence against man is also an offence against God, 01. above iii. 9, Matr.
xxv. 42-45, 1 John iv. 20, Prov. xvii. 5. The phrase ‘ speaks against
the law ' is evidently adapted to the special context, 01. i. 4 τέλειον and
τέλειος, V. 11 μαρανθήσεται, VV. 12-14 πειράζω, 15 and 18 ἀπεκύησεν, iv.
1 στρατευομένων after πόλεμοι.

οὐκ εἳ ποιητὴς νόμου.] = ποιητὴς λόγου in 1. 22, see Rom. 11. 13, 1 1111100.
11. 67. The critical attitude is adverse to the dutiful performance 01
the law. It is only by doing the will of God, so far as it is known to
us, that we learn to understand the reasons 01 it, John vii. 17.

ἀλλὰ κριτής.] Cf. Clem. Hom. xii. 26 foll. ‘ If you seek to benefit the
good only and not the bad, you undertake to perform the office 01 a
judge (κριτοῦ τὸ ἔργον) and not 01 ]ςῐ]1(111033,’110., (onst. Apost. ii. 36

ἶερεῖσίν ἐπετράπη Κρίνειῑ] μόνοις-

εῖς ἕσ-τιν νομοθέτης] One who cliticises the law 13 leally proposing to
enact a better law; but there is only one lawgiver and judge (John
v 22, 1 Cor. iv. 3- 5, Taylm J. F. p. 83), viz. he who is Lord of life
and death, i. e. whose sentence takes effect; just as he is the ruler who
exercises the right 01 sovereignty (Matt. xxii. 21). Τ110 noun νομοθ.
(1003 not occur elsewhere in N .T.‚ though both νομοθετέω and νομοθεσία
are found.

12- ὁ δυνάμενος σῶσαι καὶ ἀπολέσαι] Cf, Deub. xxxii. 39, Psa. lxviii.
20, 1 Sam. 11. 6, 2 Kings V. 7, Matt. Χ. 28 φοβήθητε μᾶλλον τὸν
δυνάμενον καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα ἀπολέσαι ἐν γεέννῃ, Lllke Vi. 9 ἔξεστι τοῖς
σάββασιν ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀπολέσαι ; John xix. 10 ἐξουσίαν ἔχω σταυρῶσαί

13. ἄγε νῦν οἱ λέγοντες.] For the interjectional use 01 ἅγε cf. Jud.
xix. 6, 2 Kings iv. 24; for its 1130 with a plural 300 below V. l, Hom.
