m THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

common meaning is ‘innate,’ as in Wisd. xii. 10 ἔμφυτος ἡ κακία αὐτῶν,
Plato J2'7·2s.¹·. 308 (J πότερον δοκεῖ εἶναι ὃιδακτὸνὴ ἀρετὴ ἢ ἔμφυτον, «1υείἰῦ M.
Apol. ii. 8 (the Stoics and others have spoken well on moral questions) διὰ
τὸ ἔμφυτον παντὶ γένει ἀνθρώπων σπέρμα τοῦ λόγου, ib. 13, and SO 06611-
menius here 3 but the word δέξασθε forbids this. We must therefore take
it as the ι1001011 word,’ i.e. a word whose property it is to root itself like
a seed in the heart: cf. Matt. xiii. 3-23 esp. ver. 21 οὐκ ἔχει ῥίζαν ἐν
ἑαυτῶ. XV. 13 πᾶσα φυτεία ἣν οὐκ ἐφύτευσεν ὁ Πατήρ μου ὁ οὐράνιος
ἐκριζωθήσεται, 1 Cor. iii. 6. Τ116 cognate words are used with
a similar meaning, as Plut. Mor. p. 125 Ε διὰ τρυφὴν τὰς στάσεις
ἐμ φ ύεσθαι ταῖς πόλεσι, Χ611.Ιι’.ᾖασ. 3 τὸ αἰδεῖσθαι ἐμφυσιῶσαι
βουλόμενος αὐτοῖς, so ἐμφυτεύω, ε’μφυτεία of grafting. The A.V. seems
to identify our word with ἐμφύτευτον, which however would be out of
place here, since the word is sewu, not grafted, in the heart. Other
examples occur in which it cannot mean ‘ innate,' e.g. Herod. ix. 94 of
Euenius, to whom the gods granted the gift of prophecy as a solane
after he had lost the sight of his eyeS‚ μετὰ ταῦτα ἔμφυτον μαντικὴν
εἶχεν, Barnab. i. 2, and ix. 9 τὴν ἔμφυτον δωρεὰν τῆς διδαχῆς αὐτοῦ θέμε-
νος ἐν ὑμῖν, where Harnack quotes Ignat. Epi.. 17 (rec. maj.)
ἔμφυτον τὸ περὶ Θεοῦ παρὰ Χριστοῦ λαβόντες κριτήριον. In like manner
σύμφυτος, which literally means ‘ congenital,' as in J os. Ant3vi. 3. 3, is
also used of that which has coalesced or grown into one since birth, as
in Rom. vi. 5 σύμφυτοι γεγόναμεν τῷ ὁμοιώματι τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ. The
Latin insitus has the same two meaningS‚ ‘ innata: and ⁴ ingrafted' or
‘incorporated’ The verb is found in the same application, though
with a different meaning, in Plut. Mor. 47. A τὸν ἐκ φιλοσοφίας ἐμφυό-
μενον εὐφυέσι νέοις δηγμὸν αὐτὸς ὁ τρώσας λόγος ἰᾶται. For the injunction
cf. Job. xi. 13, 14, Deut. xi. 18, and esp. xxx. 14 as explained in
Rom. x. 8, Jer. xxxi. 33, Acts xx. 32, 2 Cor. iii. 3, 1 Thess. ii. 13.

τὸν δυνάμενον σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν.] Cf. below ii. 14, iV. 12, v. 20,
1 Pet. i. 9 τὸ τέλος τῆς πίστεως σωτηρίαν ψυχῶν, John V. 24 ὁ τὸν λόγον
μου ἀκούων καὶ πιστεύων τῷ πέμψαντί με ἕχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον, Rom. i. 16
οὐκ ἐπαισχύνομαι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, δύναμις γὰρ Θεοῦ ἐστὶν εἷς σωτηρίαν παντὶ
τῷ πιστεύοντι, 2 Tim. iii. 15, Heb. X. 39 πίστεως ἐσμὲν εἰς περιποίησιν
ψυχῆς, Barnab. xix. S μελετῶν εἷς τὸ σῶσαι ψυχὴν τῷ λόγῳ, Clem. Hom.
iii. 54 ἦ ἀλήθεια ἡ σώζουσα ἦν καὶ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἡμῶν λόγῳ, so we
read Of σώζειν δυνάμενοι λόγοι, ζωοποιοὶ λόγοι, ib. i. 5, 6, 19. Below V.
15 the phrase is used of bodily life: see Vorst, p. 123, Hatch, p. 101.

22. γίνεσθε] The imperative ἔστε does not seem to be used in N.T.,
though ἴσθι and ἔστω are not uncommon. We may take γ. to mean
not simply ‘ be,' but ‘show yourselves more and more' ι see below iii. 1,
Matt. x. 16 γίνεσθε οὖν φρόνιμοι, ib. xxiv. 44 γ. ἕτοιμοι, 1 Cor. xiv. 20,
xv. 28, Eph. v. l.

ποιηταὶ λόγου.] Cf. iv. ll π. νόμου, Rom. ii. 13, where π. νόμου is
opposed to ἀκροατὴς ν. as being justified before God, Matt. vii. 24 πᾶς
ὅστις ἀκούει μου τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ ποιεῖ αὐτούς, Luke Vi. 46, xi. 28,
John xiii. 17, Ezek. xxxiii. 32, Sen. Ep. 108. 35 sic ista ediscamus ut
quae fverint verba, sint opera, Porphyr. Abstin. 1. 57 δι’ ἔργων ἡμῖν τῆς
σωτηρίας, οὗ δι’ ἀκροάσεως λόγων ψιλῆς γιγνομένης. The word ποιητής is
