nearest to him in blood. We read that Joseph was still alive at
the time of the visit to the Temple in His twelfth year; the
neighbours must surely have known whether these six or seven
brothers and sisters were really Joseph's children or those of
Joseph's sister-in-law. But we need not dwell further on this
point, since the assumption on which the whole theory rests is
untenable‚ as I now proceed to show.

find two sisters with the same name 2), but 1s not the most natural suainhnomo
interpretation of St. John xix. 25, ειστήκεισαιι δὲ παρὰ τῷ σταυρῷ Jesus.

τοῧ Ἰησοῦε η μητηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ἀδελφὴ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, Μαρία
ἡ τοῦ Κλωπᾶ καὶ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνή (translated in the Peshitt0‚
‘His mother and 'nis mother's sister, (md Mary of Cleopha and
Mai-y Magdalene'). If we compare this verse with Mark XV. 40
and Matt. xxvii. 56, we find that, of the three women named as
present in addition to the mother of J esus, Mary Magdalene occurs
in all three lists; ‘Mary the mother of James and Joses' of the
two synoptic Gospels is generally identified with ‘ Mary of Clopas' 3
and We then have left in Matthew ‘the mother of the sons of
Zebedee,’ in Mark ‘Salome,' and in John ‘his motlier's sister.'
Salome is generally identified with ‘the mother of the sons of
Zebedee‚' and there seems good reason also for identifying her with
‘ his mother's sister' in the Fourth Gospel. It does not seem likely
that St. John would omit the name of his own mother3 and the
indirect way in which he describes her is very similar to the way
in which he refers to himself as ‘the disciple whom Jesus loved.'
If we are right in this supposition‚ it is natural that the two
sisters should be 'paired together, and then the two other Maries‚
just as we have the Apostles arranged in pairs without a connecting
particle in Matt. x. 3, 4. If the sons of Zebedee were so nearly
related to our Lord, it helps us to understand Salome's request that
they might sit on his right hand and on his left hand in his
glory, as well as the commendation by our Lord of his mother to
one, who was not only his best—loved disciple‚ but her own nephew.
If, however, this interpretation is correct, if the sister of the Lord's
mother is not the mother of J ames and J oses, but the mother of
the sons of Zebedee, then the foundation-stone of the Hieronymian
theory is removed, and the whole fabric topples to the ground.
