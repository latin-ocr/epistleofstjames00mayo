moon turns her dark side to us . . . . is eclipsed by the shadow of the
earth, and the sun by the body of the moon.' But what a singular way
of describing this to say that it is an overshadowing which comes from
turning or change of position! ‘ Overshadowing of one another,’
ἀλλήλων ἀποσκίασμα, would have been what we should have expected.
Accordingly Schneckenburger and De Wette (Briickner) have rightly
felt that τροπή must be taken here in another and far more usual sense,
that of ‘ change in general ' (like τύχης τροπαί Plut. M or. p. 611, γνώμης
τροπή ib. Vit. 410 F), since, as the latter says, ‘schwierig ist damit
(i.e. with the idea of revolution) ἀποσκίασμα in Verbindung zu bringen.'
The liability of all that is created to change (Anton. vi. 23 τὰ
ὄντα ἐν μυρίαις τροπαῖς, καὶ σχεδὸν ου’δὲν ἑστός, ib. viii. 6 πάντα τροπαί)
is continually contrasted in Philo with the immutability of the
Creator: cf. M. 1. p. 72 πᾶν τὸ γεννητὸν ἀναγκαῖον τρέπεσθαι· ἴδιον
γάρ ἐστι τοῦτο, ὥσπερ Θεοῦ τὸ ἄτρεπτον εἶναι, ib. 82 πῶς ἄν τις πισ-
τεύσαι Θεῷ ,· ἐὰν μαθῇ ὅτι πάντα τὰ ἄλλα τρέπεται, μόνος δὲ αὐτὸς
ἄτρεπτός ἐστι, and (with a still closer resemblance to our text)
ib. p. 80 ὅταν ἁμάρτῃ καὶ ἀπαρτηθῇ ὁ νοῦς ἀρετῆς, αἰτιᾶται τὰ θεῖα, τὴν ἰδίαν
τροπὴν προσάπτων Θεῷ. Many similar passages will be found in the
treatises Leq. Alleq. and Cherub. From this opposition to the Divine
nature the word τροπή gets a second connotation implying moral frailty,
as in p. 72 ἀντιφιλονεικεῖ μοι ἡ τροπή, καὶ πολλάκις βουλόμενος καθῆκόν τι
νοῆσαι ἐπαντλοῦμαι ταῖς παρὰ τὸ καθῆκον ἐπιρροίαις, ib. 188 ὁ Θεοῦ θερα-
πευτὴς αἰώνιον ἐλευθερίαν κεκάρπωται, κατὰ τὰς συνεχεῖς τροπὰς Τῆς ἀεικινή-
του ψυχῆς ἰάσεις δεχόμενος ἐπαλλήλους-..τῆς μὲν τροπ-ἣς διὸ. τὸ φύσει θνητὸν
ἐγγινομένης, τῆς δὲ ἐλευθερίας διὰ τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ θεραπείαν ἐπιγινομένης.
Schneckenburger takes τροπή here in Philo’s sense, and translates
obumbratio quae oritur eac inconstantia naturae. This gives a very good
sense, ‘ overshadowing of mutability‚⁷ as one might speak of ‘ an over—
shadowing of disgrace’: no changes in this lower world can cast a
shadow on the unchanging Fount of light. Or we may take τροπῆς as
a qualitative genitive, and interpret as Stolz does, after Luther,
‘keine abwechselnde Verdunkelung.' Beyschlag maintains that this
would require τροπὴ ἅποσκ’,σώμασι-ος,1 but why may not ‘overshadowing
of change⁷ serve to express ‘changing shadow' (Le. an overshadow-
ing which changes the face of the sun), just as well as ‘a hearer of
forgetfulness' in ver. 25 to express ‘a forgetful hearer' or ‘ the world
of wickedness ’ in iii. 6 130 express ‘ the wicked world’ 2 The meaning
of the passage will then be ‘God is alike incapable of change in his
own nature (παραλλαγή) and incapable of being changed by the action
of others <ἆ.ποσκίασμα).’Ι On the unchangeableness of God compare Mal.
iii. 6, Heb. xiii. 8. It is on this doctrine that Plato founds his argu-
ment against the possibility of a Divine Incarnation (Rep. ii. 380 foll).

18. βουληθεὶς ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς] So far from God tempffing us to evil,
His will is the cause of our regeneration. It is the doctrine expressed
by St. Paul (Eph. i. 5) προορίσας ἡμᾶς εἷς υἱοθεσίαν διὰ Ἰ.Χ. εἷς αὐτόν, κατὰ
τὴν εὐδοκίαν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ, Rom. xii. 25 by St. Peter (i. 1. 3) ὁ
