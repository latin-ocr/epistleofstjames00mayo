umcal professions o] whatever kind. In its plain positive teachinq
his Epistle affords a common platform, for Christians of every (leyree
of attainment, from which they niscy advance aqain with new hope
to such further developments of the saith, as it may be yiven to

each from above to receive and to profit by.

The eiqhth and ninth Chapters of the Introduction deal with the
Grammar and Style of the Epistle, and, in some deyree, with those
of the New Testament writers yenerally. As a corollary to these,
I have, in the tenth Chapter, pointed out some oly'ections to the
hypothesis which has been lately revived anwnyst us, that the
Greek is a translation from an Aramaic original.

As reyards the Teaet I have been almost entirely dependent on the
labours of others, especially those of Tischendorf, Bishop Westcott and
Dr. Hert. In the very rare cases in which I have ventured to depart
from a reading] of WH„ I have carefully eaplained my reasons for
doin9 so in the Notes. The comparison of three Latin Versions of the
Epistle, and the collations of the Codex Patiriensis and Codex
Bobiensis will, I hope, be found useful by those who are interested in
textual criticism.

In the Notes it has been my aim, treatiny the bools lihe any other
ancient writin9‚ to ascertain the precise meaniny of each sentence, .
phrase, and word, as it was intended by the writer, and understood
by those to whom his Epistle was addressed. The names of previous
annotators, to whom I am indebted, will be found in the eleventh
Chapter of the Introduction. In the Com-ments which follow I have
in the first place viewed the Epistle more as a whole, tracing] the
yeneral connexion of ideas and illustrating] and discussiny the wider
questions involved: aoid, in the second place, reyardiny it as an 1·
inteyral portion of the canonical Scriptures, which are recoynized 1

by all Christians as authoritative in matters of saith, I have 1301

some small extent endeavoured to show in what sense its teaehing] is 1
