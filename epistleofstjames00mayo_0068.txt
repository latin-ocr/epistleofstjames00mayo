xliv THE EPISTLE OF ΞΤ. JAMES

which appears in James i. 6, 11. 4· is found also in Matt. xxi. 21,
Mark xi. 23, 2403 the royal law of ι11111103 ii. 8 is the same of
which it is said in Matt. xxii. 39 that on it and its companion
law, which enjoins love to God, ‘hang all the law and the
prophets’3 the desire to be called Rabbi is condemned alike in
James iii. and Matt. xxiii. 8-12; the dangers of hasty speaking
are pointed out in James iii. 2 and in Matt. xii. 373 the Judge
‘standeth before the door' in Jamcs v, 9, ‘he is nigh even at the
‹loors' in Matt. xxiv, 33, Mark xiii. 293 the woes denounced against
the prosperous and sels-confident in Jamcs iv. 9, v. 1 are also found
in Lukc vi. 24, 253 the light, and the truth, and the freedorn in-
spircd by the truth, of which 30 11111011 13 said in the discourscs
reported by St. John, are recalled to us in James i. 17, 18, 253 and
there are many other similar parallels which will suggest them—
selves to the attentive reader.

The thought naturally suggests itsclf‚ If St.. James in his short

”’3· Epistle has preserved so much of the tcaching of our Lord as

recorded in the Gospels—more, it has been said, than is 0011-
tained in all the other Epistles put together—is it not probable
that 110 lnay have also preserved sayings of our Lord not re-
corded in the Gospels? Dr. A. Resch, in his collection of such
unrecorded sayings,1 includes several verses from our Epistle
which are mentioned in my note on i. 12: ‘Blessed is the man that
endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved he shall
receive the crown of life, which he promised to them that love him?
This is repeated 111 nearly the same words in ii. 5, ‘Did not God
choose them that are poor to the world to be rich in saith and hcirs
of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him 2 ' and in
2 Tim. iv. 8, 1 Pet. V. 4, Apoc. ii. 10. Beyond this passage, however,
I aui not satisfied that any of those quoted by Resch are certainly
to be included in the Aqrafflm, though it can hardly be doubted
that there must be other echoes of Christ's words in the Epistle‚
which we are now unable to identify, as they do not occur in the
Gospels and are not expressly ascribed to Him either by St. J ames
or by any early writer. Dr. Rcsch seems to regard the frequency
of quotation by Subsequent writers as a proof that the passage was
originally uttercd by Christ, but is not this to assume that it was
impossible for a text from St. Jaines to get into general circulation ἓ
