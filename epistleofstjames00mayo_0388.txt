128 THE EPIs'PJAE (W sT. JAMES

Cope’s notes, Cic. Tusa iv. 17 invidentiam esse dicunt aeyrimoniam
susceptam propter alterins ‘res secundas, qnae nihil noceant invidenti...
aemulatio autem est aem-itudo si eo, quod concupierit, alius potiatur, ipse
careat, Trench, Syn. p. 100. Both are distinguished from ἐπιθ. as
denoting a feeling towards a person rather than a thing. The word
ζῆλος with its cognates embraees the two meanings, emulation'] and
jealousy, and it is used also of vehement desire, our ‘ zeal '‚ in a‘good
sense. For examples see Acts v. 17 and xiii. 45 ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,
Rom. xiii. 13, 1 Cor. iii. 3, 2 Cor. xii. 20, Gal. v. 20, and above iii. 14,
in all which places the R. V. has ⁵ jealousy ² : similarly the verb, Acts
vii. 9 οἶ πατρίαρχαι ζηλώσαντες τὸν Ἰωσὴφ ἀπέδοντο, ib. XVii. 5, 1 Cor. xiii.
4, Clem. Rom. 11. 4 μὴ καταλαλεῖν ἀλλήλων, μὴ ζηλοῦν. For ζῆλος 111
good sense cf. John ii. 17 ὁ ζῆλος τοῦ οἴκου σου καταφάγεταί με ‘ the zeal
(hely jealousy) for thy house will devour 1ne‚’ Rom. x. 2 ζῆλον Θεοῦ
ἔχουσιν, 2 Cor. xi. 2, ib. vii. 7 τὸν ὑμῶν ζῆλον ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ, V. 11, Phil. iii.
(5 κατὰ ζῆλος ὃίωκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ‚· so ζηλωτὴς τοῦ Θεοῦ Acts xxii. 3, τοῦ
νόμου ib. xxi. 20, καλῶν ἔργων Tit. ii. 14. The verb takes an acc. in the
sense of ‘seek eagerly‚' τὰ χαρίσματα 1 Cor. xii. 31, ζηλῶ ὑμᾶς 2 Cor. xi.
2, Gal. iv. 17, ἐζήλωσα τὸ ἀγαθόν, Sir. li. 18, μὴ ζηλοῦτε θάνατον, WViSd.
i. 12.

ε’πιτυχεῖν.] Used absolutely Gen. xxxix. 2 (Ἰωσὴφ) ἣν ἀνὴρ ἐπιτυγχάνων
(‘p1¹osperous'); with gen. Heb. xi. 33 ἐπέτυχον ἐπαγγελιῶν, ib. vi. 153
with acc. Rom. xi. 7 τοῦτο οὐκ ἐπέτυχεν.

οὐκ ἕχετε.] Repeated like αἰτείτω 111 1. 5, 6. It is not a further step.

διὰ τὸ μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι tuas] The subject of the infinitive is expressed
as in iii. 3, where see n.

3. αἰτεῖτε καὶ οὐ λαμβάνετε] Yet in i. 5 118 had said, quoting from the
Sermon on the Mount, αἰτείτω καὶ δοθήσεται. But the promise is not
unconditional. In the former passage stress is laid on the need for
simple saith in the worshippers, here on the right choice of things to
πα for.

I {shy is the active voice used here, and the middle immediately
before and afterwards? The latter has a slight additional shade
of meaning, which may be illustrated by the distinction (noted by
Dobree in Arnold's n. on Thuc. v. 43) between δεινὰ ἐποίουν ‘they
expressed,⁷ and δεινὰ ἐποιοῦντο ‘ they felt indignation' 3 and by Donald-
son's distinction between ἰδεῖν ‘to see’ and ἰδέσθαι ‘to behold,' ‘sce
with interest ’ (‘ in this particular use of the middle it will generally
be found to imply a certain special diligence and earnestness in the
action' Winer, p. 318) ε cf. for this ‘ dynamio ' or ‘ subjective' middle
Kriiger Gr. ξ 52. 8 and 10. Sturz in Lex. Xen. sv. quotes Schol.
Aristoph. 156 αἰτοῦμαι τὸ αὐτὸ (τῷ aia-82), ὥσπερ ποιῶ καὶ ποιοῦμαι, πλὴν ὅτι
τὸ μὲν αἰτῶ τὸ ἁπλῶς ζητῶ, τὸ δὲ αἰτοῦμαι τὸ μεθ’ ἱκεσίας, Phavorin. αἰτοῦμαι
τὸ μετὰ παρακλήσεως αἰτῶ καὶ ἱκετεύω. ἏῙΙῙΘΒ αἰτεῖτε is thus opposed to
αἰτεῖσθε, it implies using the words, without the spirit, of prayer. Other-
wise, where there is no special reason to emphasize this shade of meaning,
the active may be used to include the force of the middle, just as μετα-
πέμπω is used in the sense of ‘send for,’ which strictly belongs to
μεταπέμπομαι. Ι add a few exemplos of the combination of the two
