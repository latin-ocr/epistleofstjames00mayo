ἔχετε πίστιν (θεοῦ, Acts iii. (i π. τοῦ ὀνόματος, Rom. iii. 22 δικαιοσύνη
(θεοῦ διὸ. πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, Gal. ii. lo, Apoc. xiv. 12. The same

τῆς δόξης,] This gcnitive has been variously interpreted as having an
objectiv0‚ a s11l›j‹·‹·tix'e,‹›1· a qualitative force, and been connected in
turn hy ‹lill'orcnt couuiwutators with every substantive in the sentence:
with προ(τωπολημψιίιις (l) by Erasmus, Calvin, Heisen, Michaelis;
with πίστιν (2) hy tho Pes-hitto, Grotius, Cornelius a Lapide, Hammond
and Hofmann3 with the whole or a portion of the phrase τοῦ Κυρίου
...Χριστοῦ (ῑῖ) by the majority of commentatore. 1. Erasmus trans-
lates ⁴ (Ῑιιηι summm slwle'o quo aa: succ quisque opinione quemlibet
aestima ’ ; (mlviii, ⁶ Ne [ιι ‹ecceptc'om'lms persomwum fidem habeatis-...ex
opim'‹›1w‚' which he explains ⁶ Nam ‹lum opum vel honorum, opinio
nostros oculos perstre‘uylt, veritas supminm'cmn' Both interpretations
would make δόξης a subjective genitive, denoting the cause or source of
προσωπολημψία. Michaelis, on the other hand, gives it an objective
soree, translating midaiiratio hominum secundum externum splendo-
rem'3 and much in the sanie way, Heisen. It is now generally recog-
nised that the order of the words renders this explanation of the
construction impossible. 2. The Peshitto, followed by Grotius, Ham-
niond, Hofmann, dc, translates ‘faith of (in) the glory of Christ’
(objectivc genitive). Huther, ‘Christ-given faith in the glory to be
rcvealed’ 3 Gataker, followed by Hottoman, ‘the glorious saith in
Christ ' (qualitative genitive). Though the interval between the two
words πίστιν and δόξης in my opinion entirely precludes any qualitative
connexion, it is perhaps not so decisive against Grotius' interpretation.
To a certain extent we may find a parallel in i. 2 ; τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς
πίστεως, ‘the proof of your faith,' is not unlike τὴν πίστιν...Ἰησοῦ Χρισ-
τοῖ· τῆς δόξης ‘ the faith in Christ's glory ’3 but, of course the harshness
becomes greater with every additional word which separates them, and
with the greater iuiportance of those words. 3. It remains to consider
the interpretations which make τῆς δόξης depend upon the whole, or a
part, of the phrase preceding. These may be classified as follows:
(ιι) δόξης depending on Χριστοῦ only3 (b) depending on Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῧ;
(ν) on τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν; (ιί) on τοῦ Κυρίου understood3 (e) on the whole
phrase τ. Κ. ἡ. Ἰ Χ. (α) ‘The Messiah of glory' ε so Laurentius, Schul-
thess, Lange, Bouman. The objection to this is, that it is impossible
thus to separate Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, and that in any case it would require
tlu¹ article before Χριστοῦ. (h) So Ewald : ‘ Den Glauben unsers Heri-n,
‚lesus (flu-istus der llerrliehkeitt’ This seems to make an arbitrary
division of the words, and is also liable to the same objections as (e).
Mol-cover, do we ever find a proper name used with the genitive of
quality? (a) ‘Our Lord of glory, Jesus Christ! So Schneckenburger
l)e thte, &Vivsingelz lf this were the writer's meaning, why did he
not phu-c the words τῆς δόξης after ἡμῶνΊ (d) ‘ Our Lord Jesus Christ
(the Lord) of glory.’ »So Bauiugarten, Semler and others3 but it is
without parallel, and is not supported by any of the later commen-
tator-s. (ι’) ‘of our glorious l1ord Jesus Clu-ist! So Kern, Alford,
