ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxv

a previous Chapter, between the parallel passages in St.
James and in the Epistle to the Romans and the First
Epistle of St. Peter. If I am not greatly mistaken‚ that
comparison has proved not only that St. Jaines has not copied
from the other Epist-les, but that these show distinct traces of hav-
ing been written with reference to his Epistle. The strength how-
ever of the general argument is not to be measured by the strength
of any one line of proof, however irrefragable we may deem it, but
by the cumulative force of many converging probabilities. After
having given many years' study to the subject, I am convinced
that the more closely it is examined, the more will this hypo-
thesis of the priority of our Epistle be found to meet all diffi-
culties, and explain all the :facts of the case.

These who take a different view suppose that it was either

written by St. J ames towards the close of his life, or that it is a ὦ

forgery from the hand either of an Ebionite or of a Christian

Essene, whether in the first or second century. The former view πε c

is maintained by Kern (ed. 2), VViesinger, Woldemar Schmidt,
Bruno Briickner, Wordsworth‚ and Farrar (Early Days of Christ-
imity, p. 310 foll).

The reasons assigned by the last-mentioned writer are (1) ‘ the {1¹28 iffi] ‘gf
prevalence of the name of Christ, instead of the title the Christ.' “013³ss

But the name Christ never occurs by itself in this Epistle, but only ω ¹0 Θ

111 the phrase Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, which is found without the article
in every book of the New Testament, except the Gospel of St.
Luke and the Third Epistle of St. John 3 whereas the phrase Ἰησοῦς·
ὁ Χριστός or ὁ Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς occurs nowhere, except in the Acts
(four times) and once in Coloss. ii. 6.

A second argument is ‘the condition and wide dissemination of
the churches to which it is addrfessed which make it necessary to
assume that‘ many years had elapsed since the day of Pentecost.'
As to this, there 1s nothing to suggest the wide dissemination of
the churches to which it is addressed‚ beyond the phrase ‘The
Twelve Tribes of the Diaspora,' which is no doubt wide enough in
conception, but defines nothing as to the actual extent of country
occupied. It is consistent with two copies sent, say, to Antioc-h
and to Damascus, or with one hundred copies distributed through-
out the East. All that it implies is that the advice contained in
the letter is in the opinion of the writer suitable for all or any Jews
