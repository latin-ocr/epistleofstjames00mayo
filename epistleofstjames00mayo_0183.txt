ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMEs clix

form twice in Gal. 11. 6 ’πρόσωπον Θεὸς ἀνθρώπου οὐ λαμβάνει,
where the absence of the articles gives a sharper point to the
antithesis, and vi. 7 Θεὸς οὐ μυκτηρίζεταιε in both cases the
absence of the article brings into greater prominence the charac-
teristic quality and connotation of the noun, not so much ‘ God'
simply, but ‘ He who is G0d.' The rule is less strict in regard to
Κύριος, because this was freely used without the article in the
LXX. for the Sacred N aine: so we find it in quotations (Rom. iv.
8, ix. 28,- 29, 1 Cor. iii. 20), especially in the phrase λέγει Κύριος
(Acts Vll· 49, xv. 17), but also in other passages, as Mark xiii. 20,
Acts xii. 11. Α similar word is Χριστός, which in the Gospels
usually has the article, meaning ‘the Anointed One,' but in the
Epistles has become a proper name and drops the article. It has
been often debated whether νόμος is used in a similar way without
the article to denote the Mosaic law. It is used of this with 1116
article ii. 10 ὅλου τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ, 11. 9 ἐλεὙχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ
νόμου, but without 1116 article in ii. 11 (γέγονας παραβάτης νόμου,
iv. 11 οὐκ εἶ ποιητὴς νόμου, in both which cases the R. V. has
‘the law] but perhaps the Greek would be more exact]y given by
a compound, ‘law-breaker,' ‘law-observor? So iv. 11 oscara-
λαλῶν ἀδελφοῦ...καταλαλεῖ νόμου καὶ κρίνει νόμον, where also
R. V. has ‘the law,' but perhaps a more correct rendering would
be ‘ speaks against law and judges law,’ the absence of the article
serving, as in the case of Θεὸς above, to give prominence to the
connotation of the noun. A similar word is λόγος, which is found
with the article in i. 21 τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον, without it in i. 22
ποιηταὶ λόγου, 23 ἀκροατὴς λόγου, 111 both of which the R.V. has
‘the word,’ but the more strict interpretation would be ‘word—
doers,' ‘ word-hearerf

A noun may be qualified by the addition of an adjective or
participle, or of a genitive, or an adverb or adverbial phrase. If the
article is used, a noun thus qualified may take one of three forms,
either (1) ὁ καλὸς παῖς, ὁ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς πατήρ, 61 (2) ὁ παῖς ὁ καλός,
τὴν δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐκ τοῦ νόμου Rom. x. 5, or (3) the less common
παῖς ὁ καλός, ἐν ’πίστει τῇ τοῦ Τὶοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ Gal. ii. 20. With 1116
genitive or adverbial phrase we find also, instead of the more
idiomatic (1) or (2), 1116 loose collocation (4) τὴν πίστιν τοῦ
Κυρίου, where the article is attached to the governing substantive,
which is either followed or preceded by the genitive or adverbial
