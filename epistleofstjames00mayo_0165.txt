ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPIsTLE cxli

(p. 845). The former branch is represented by the Johannean and the Pas-
toral epistles‚ the epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, which with Volkmar’s
expurgations may be regarded as a fairly genuine piece‚ the Ignatian epistles,
together with that of J ude and the second of Peter. The latter branch is repre-
sented by the second epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, written
about the same tim-e as the Gospel of Matthew (that is, towards the middle of
the 2nd century), the epistle of J ames and the Didache‚ which last Pflei-
derer considers to be later than Hermas and possibly later than Clemens
Alexandrinus. This Catholicized Paulinism is characterized by a practical un-
dogmatic tone, reminding one of the Synoptic Gospels.

This brief sketch of Pfleiderer's view of the general development
of Christianity was needed in order to enable the reader to appre-
ciate his remarks on J ames in particular (pp. 865-880).

Pfleidereragrees with Schwegler that our epistle is just the Shepherd stripped He considers
of its Apocalyptical imagery. In both writings we have a protest on behalf of ffifflotrhg‘f

Our epistle must evidently belong to the post-Pauline period; otherwise it non—owed
must have contained some reference to the controversia] topics of which St. s¹⁰¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹³'
Paul treats, such as the abrogation of the Mosaic law, circumcision,
sabbaths and festivals, the position of Israel as the chosen people, the
relation of the Old to the New Covenant, Sto. The question then arises, How
long after the death of St. Paul must it be placed? We are enabled to answer
this partly from the lateness of patristic evidence as to the existence of the
epistle, and partly from its dependence on other Christian writings. (l) As
to the former oui· epistle is in a worse position than any other of the books
of the N. T. Origen is the first to quote it directly, and he ex-
pressly says that it was not generally recognized as canonical. There is no
reference to it in Clemens Alexandrinus or Irenaeus or Tertullian‚ not even in
the Clementines Moreover it is omitted in the Muratorian canon, which
recognizes the Shepherd. This silence of the oldest witnesses is inexplicable
if it belonged to the Apostolic age. (2) The writer was acquainted with the
epistles to the Romans and Galatiam, as is apparent from his use of the
Pauline formula of ‘justification by faith’3 also with the epistle to the
Hebrews, the Apocalypse (including the most recent portion of the latter,
which dates from the time of Hadrian), the lst epistle of Peter, above
all with Hermas, whom Pfleiderer regards as the older writer, because the
aphorisms of St. J ames are there found embedded in a suitable context. In
any case the two writings were composed under similar circumstances and
without doubt nearly at the same time. These facts prove that the address to
the Twelve Tribes of the Diaspora is not to be understood literally. If there
were then any pure J ewish churches it could only have been in Judea, which
is excluded by the term Diaspora. Besides what reason could there be for confin-
ing the exhortation of the epistle to the J ewish Christians Ζ It was not they
but the Gentiles who were in danger of trusting in saith without works. We
must therefore understand the phrase in reference to the true Israel scattered
throughout the world. It isa mistake to lay any stress on the term ‘syna-
gogue‚ ' which is freely used of Christian churches by Hermas and Ignatius.

The aim of the writer is the restoration of a retiring unworldly Christianity
of sels-renunciation and brotherly kindness: what he especially attacks is the

worldliness of the upper classes. His condemnation of a wisdom which he
