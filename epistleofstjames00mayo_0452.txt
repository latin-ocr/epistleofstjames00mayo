192 COMMENT

vocation ’ζ Are 1101 some men called to be artists, poets, philosophers‚
student< or teau-hers, as other men are called to be men of business
and action? Is not action itself crippled and wasted from want of
knowledge ἶ [s it not 0116 of the most deplorablc features of modern
life, that (here is so much resiless aetivity with so little thought as to
the cml 10 be pursued, and the means to he employed for arriving at
the end ; so much talk and profession, and so little feeling; so much
fuss, and so little real enjoylneut ?

We may allow all this, and yet hold with Bp. Butler and St. James,
that it is a disastrous thing for a man to rest satis-fied with his own
‘passive impressions' If a poet like Wordsworth devotes himself
steadily to the task of raising the standard of thought and feeling
among his countrymen, or a jurisprudent‚ such as Bentham, lives
laborious days in order to reform men's ideas of what law should be,
and so ultimately to bring about that vast improvement in the statute
law of England which has been witnessed in this century, no one
could deny that these were in the. highest sense men of action. It is
true there have been artists and philosophers who were less cousciously
practical, ‘ who sang but as the linnets sing,' who wrote or composed
in obedience to the inncr impulse without any definite idea of
benefiting others 3 whose work nevel-theless has been rich in practical
results of the greatest importance. Here too, for the work to produce
such results, there must have been a high degree of mental aetivity,
and a conscientious effert to render faithfully the impression or the
thought by which the writer or artist was possessed. Το borrow St.
J ames' figure, no great work of art was ever produced by a mere hasty
glauce at the mirror of the Divine Word. But St. J ames is of course
speaking primarily of moral and spiritual truth. He does not deny
that one who preaches or theol-izes on these subjects without prac-
tising his own precepts may put forward thoughts which may be good
and useful for other men3 nor that he may even be a medium, like
Balaam, for divine inspiration, though he should be found in the end
fighting, like Balaam, for the enemies of God: but what he says is
that, to the theorizer himself, moral theory without practice is of no
avail, but rather a dangerous snare as fostering the habit of self-
decept-ion.

SLow To SPEAK.

But is it not the duty of a Christian to let his light shine‘l to
preach [the Gospel to every creature? Does not the Psalmist say
(lxxii. 74), ‘ my mouth shall speak of thy righteousness all the day,' and
St. ‚James himself (v. 20) give a special encouragement to one who
‘ eonverts a sinner from the error of his way '2 011 the other hand, in
611. iii., he warns his readers against being too ready to take upon
themselves the office of tencher, and urges on them the necessity of
controlling the tongue. Doubtless we are to understand him in the
text as deprecating rash and hasty speech on religious subjects, in

‘ aecordancc with the teaching of the wise man, ‘ God is in heaven and thou

on earth3 therefore let thy words be few' (Eccl. v. 1, 2). A grave
