ccxx.· Α ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

3rd Epistles of St. John, which would, however, naturally be
regarded as appendages to the F irst Epistle.

A secondary and later meaning of the term is derived from its
use in reference to the Ohurch. An epistle came to be called
catholic as being catholic in spirit and accepted by the Catholic
Church : hence it, is sometimes equivalent to ‘ canonical.' ¹
