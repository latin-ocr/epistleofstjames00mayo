RELATION ΤΟ OTHER BOOKS OF THE N .T. xci

reference to the argument of St. J ames and the use which might be

, made os it by Judaizers3 but put the case the other way, suppose

St. James to have written after St. Paul 3 and how inconceivable
is it that he should have made no attempt to guard his position
against such an extremely sormidable attack 1 Again if St James
was really opposed to St. Paul and desired to maintain that man
was saved, not by grace, but by obedience to the law of Moses,
which was incumbent alike on Gentile and on Jew, why has he
never uttered a syllable on the subject, but confined himself to the
task of proving that a saith which bears no fruits is a dead saith 2
As I am on the subject os saith it may be convenient to mention
here that the treatment of this subject in the Epistle to the
Hebrews is such as to suggest that the writer was acquainted with
our Epistle, as well as with the Epistle to the Romans. The language
of St. James was liable to be misunderstood because he does not ¹
state distinctly what he means by ‘saith' In the eleventh chap-
ter of the Hebrews the author begins with a definition os saith
and illustrates its power by a long series os examples. In ver. 6 110
explains why it is impossible to please God without saith. In
vi. 15 Abraham is said to have obtained the promise through 1115
patience (μακροθυμήσας); in xi. 8 his saith is evinced by 1115
obedience to the call to leave his own country and go he knew
not where3 in ver. 9 by his living as a stranger in the land os
promise awaiting the establishment of the City of God. In ver. 11
saith is said to have enabled Sarah to conceive when she was past
age. In ver. 17 it is pointed out that the offering up os Isaac by
Abraham fiowed naturally from his saith, that He who had given
the promise ‘ In Isaac shall thy seed be called ' was able even to
raise him from the dead. In vv. 13—16 it is said os the patriarchs
collectively, that they died in saith not having received the pro-
mises but having saluted them asar off, desiring a better country,
that is an heavenly. Faith is exhibited throughout the chapter
not as in rivalry with works‚ as might seem to be the case in the
writings of St. Paul and St. JameS‚ but as the cause and ground os
all the0 noble deeds os the ancient worthies. Thus, though it may
be true to say with St. J ames ‘that Rahab was justified by works,' ‚
yet it is 3 higher and deeper truth to say that she was saved by

saith, since her works were only the natural outcome and fruit os
her saith.
