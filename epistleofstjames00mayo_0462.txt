(ii. 1), that those who are rich in saith are heirs os the promised
kingdom (ii, 5). By this saith he means trust in the loving will of
God revealed to us in Christ, and the reception 01 His word into our
301113, as seed into a good soil (i. 17, 18, 21). If we retain our trust
in God’s all-wise, just and loving Providence, in spite 01 1116 trials
which He permitS, the habit 01 endurance is strengthened in uS‚ and
thus we grow up to the full stature os Christian manhood (i. 4). The
opposite to saith is worldliness: our fait-h is shown to be tainted with
worldliness 11 we favour the rich above tho poor (i. 27, ii. 2—4). In
the verses which we have now to deal with, saith appears in a different
light. lt is no longer the essence 01 Christianity‚ but a mere dead
seinblance, or empty profession 01 saith. For the employment 01 1116
sanie word πίστις 10 denote the two kinds os saith, we may compare the
different meanings of πειρασμός and πειράζεσθαι 111 i. 2, and 13, the
former used 01 a tempting for good, the latter of a tempting sor evil 3
the use os σοφία 10 express both a heavenly and an earthly wisdom
in iii. 15, 17, 1 Cor. i. 17-ii. 16, and so 01 πανουργία 111 Sir. xxi. 123 also
the use 01 ἔρις 111 Hesiod (Op. 11—30) sor the emulation which is good,
and the quari-elsomeness which is hurtful. This use of the same name
101· different things is natural enough in the rough and ready speech
of men little accustomed to metaphysical analysis or subtle refinements
01 language, and would be intentionally adopted by those who had to
address such hearers, The change os meaning is however prepared sor
here by the use 01 1116 word λέγῃ 111 ver. 14 ε 1101 saith in itsels‚ but the
profession 01 saith is declared to be 01 110 avail. The thought 01 saith
is apparently suggested by the statement in ver. 13 that ‘love (com-
passion) is the only thing which can triumph over judgment,’ judgment
being without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. To this an objec-
tion is supposed to be made by the worldly-minded Christian 01 ver. 1 :
‘ Will not saith also triumph against judgment'l What is the good 01
being an orthodox believer, 11 Ι am no better off than a Samaritan
or a Gentile or an unbelieving Jew? ' 81. James replies by the
parable 01 1116 talking philanthropist. Just as a profession 01 philan-
thropy unaccompanied by kind actions is 01 110 good to the needy, so a
profession 01 saith unaccompanied by righteous actions is os no good to
ourselves 3 both are alike a mere hypocrisy in the sight of God. Such
profession is indeed the dead carcase of genuine religion. But 111 1116
midst 01 11113 diatribe against a dead saith, St. J ames gives some further
ραι-1101111113 01 a true saith, such as Abraham's (ver. 22) ε ⁶ saith
cooperated with his works and by works was saith made perfect’,
words which arc in close agreement with St. Paul's teaching as to
‘ saith which worketh by love,' and the ‘ fruits of the spirit!

If 81. James were not so sully justified by the subsequent history 01
1116 Church, we might 110 inclined to wonder at the scathing words in
which 116 expresses his contempt sor those who place their confidence
in the orthodoxy of their creed. But it may be questioned whether
any sorni 01 161131113111 has been quite so inischievous‚ so destructive to
all kindly feeling as well as to moral and spiritual and intellectual
progress, as the fetish 01 orthodoxy, i.e. the idea that the assent to a
