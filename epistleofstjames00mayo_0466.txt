206 COMMENT

dangcrs arising from the over-freedom of the youthful Ohurch have long
ago bcen effectually guardcd against in the Church of England by the
denial of the right of speech to any but the clei-gy. But it may perhaps
he questioned whether St. Jamcs would have consented to purchase
immunity from the disorder of which he complains, hy investing one
of the teachers, not selected for that particular post, as being specially
qualified for it, either by the congregation, or by the Apostles, or by
the Church at large, but merely nominated by some wealthy person,
perhaps one who was an entire stranger to the congregation, and who
had never given proof of his qualifications to exercise such an important
trust,—-whether, I say, St. James would have approved of investing a
teacher, so chosen, with exclusive authority over the ritual and the
teaching of the congregation, and would further have thought it
expedient to enable him, however incompetent or unsuited for that
particular post, to disregard the wishes and feelings alike of his
ecclesiastica] superiors and of the people committed to his charge, by
ensuring to him a practically irremovable tenure. And yet, after all.
our present system does not make St. James' caution inapplicable.
We may silence the laity, and still leave too many teachers 3 since it
does not follow that, because a man is ordained and has the charge of
a parish, he must therefore be able to preach. A man may be an
excellent parish priest without having the qualifications of a prophet
and teacher.

We must not, however, suppose that the cantion is limited to
preaching. It applies to all who set themselves up as instructors of
others, whether as schoolmasters, lecturers, politicianS, journalists,
critics, writers of whatsoever kind, who make themselves responsible,
not only for their own actions, but for the seed they sow in the minds
of others. As there never was a time when people presses] more
eagerly into these professions, so there never was a time when it
behoved each man more seriously to ask himself, what kind of voc-ation
he has for the work which he proposes to undertake‚ and whether he
has conscientiously endeavoured to prepare himself for it. As regards
education‚ perhaps the time has now come when it may be possible to
require a certificate, both of adequate knowledge and of ability to
teach, from others besides the teachers in our elementary schools.

On a first reading, there is to a western mind something odd and
exaggerated in St. James‘ remarks as to the Tongue. The tongue is
of course merely the innocent instrument employed by the free will of
man. The rhetorical figure by which it stands for the abuse of the
faculty of speech, and of which examples have been given in the note,
need not however imply a want of earnestness iu the speaker, any
more than Cranmer's apostrophe t0··' this unworthy hand.' In some
cases there can be no doubt that temptation comes from ⁴ the pleasures
encamped in 0111·1n‹·111be1·s' (below iv. l). There would be nothing
inappropriate, for instance, in ascl-ibing to the palate the evils which
arise from gluttony. But there is no physical pleasure in the actual
inovement of the tongue, and bnt little in hearing oui-solves talk.
