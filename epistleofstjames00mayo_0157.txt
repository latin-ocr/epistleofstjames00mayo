ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPlsTLE cxxxiii

He considers that it was written at a time of degeneracy, when the J ewish
element in the Church had lost all significance; that perhaps the title may
be after all genuine, because Christians had then learnt to regard themselves as
the true Israel, strangers and pilgrims in the world, waiting for the hour of their
Lord’s appearing. If it had been really intended for Jews, there must have
been more of local colouring. The instances alleged for this local colouring
are not exclusively applicable to Jews.

The only argument here which seems to call for examination is Itgstgachinss

founded on the fact that the Jewish Christians are charged with 133115223
laying too much stress, not on their ritual (the works of the law), bgffipsi’fflffist
but on their orthodox belief in one God. No doubt there is a ffehssssfisslffii
striking difference between the language of St. James and the Jssss'gssssssst-

language of St. Paul on this point ; a difference entirely in accord· ingto Jews;
ance with all we know of the two nien. St. J ames, living among
Jews, himself practising the Jewish rituaL saw no objection to Jewish
Christians continuing their ritual observances, as long as they
ascribed no merit to them. He warns his readers, however, not to
suppose that the outward rite could commend them to God (i. 27) ;
the religious service which God approved consisted in charity and
unworldliness. Is not this perfectly natural teaching from a Jewish
apostle to Jewish believers, who would at once recognize it as a·
re-publication of the teaching of Isaiah and Micah on the same
subject? Does then the improbability consist in the assumption
that Jewish Christians were in danger of trusting in their orthodox
monotheism to the neglect of the perfect law of love? It is plain
at any rate that if there were any people who were likely to pride
themselves on this belief, they must have been Jews by birth, not
Gentiles. Moreover we know as a matter of fact that Jews did
pride themselves just on this point, did believe that their ortho-
doxy placed them on a pinnacle above all other people, and was of
itself efficient to salvation; compare the words of J ustin spoken
to a J ew (To‘yplc. p. 370 D), ‘You and others like you (m Judaizing
Christians) deceive yourselves withwords, saying that, though you
should be sinum, yet because you know God, the Lord will not
impute sin to you,' and see Lightfoot, Gal. pp. 154-164„ and the
quotations in iny note on ii. 19. In the same way they are rebuked
by John the Baptist and by our -Lord for priding themselves on their
descent from Abraham (Matt. iii. 8, 9, vii. 21-23, Luke xiii. 24-30).
It would be just as rational to deny that the sapientia] books of
the Bible and Apocrypha were written for Jews by Jews, as to
deny this of the Epistle of St. J ames.
