RELATION ΤΟ OTHER BOOKs OF THE NT. lxxxix

phrases or ideas, sometimes introducing a distinction for the
purpose of avoiding ambiguity‚ at other times distinctly contro-
verting his arguments as liable to be misapplied‚ though conscious
all the while of a general agreement in his conclusions. As
examples of borrowing, sometimes with additions and improve-
ments, I will only refer here to Rom. ii. 13, 25, v. 3, vii. 23,
xiv. 4⁴, 22. As examples of new distinctions introduced compare
James ii. 24 ἐξ ἔργων δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος καὶ οὐκ ἐκ 1πίστεως
μόνον, with Gal. ii. 16 οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ἕρΎων νόμου,
ἐὰν μὴ διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.

The controversial matter must be dealt with at greater length.
The two main points at issue are (1) the necessity of works‚1
(2) Abraham's justification by faith. James had said over and
over again ‘ Faith without works is dead' (ii. 17, 20, 24, 26); his
meaning being (as is plain from ver. 14, and the illustration of a
philanthrophy which is limited to words (vv. 15, 16), as well as
from the whole tone and argument of the Epistle)‚ not to depreci-
ate faith, which is with him not less than with St. Paul the very
foundation of the Christian life (cf. i. 3, 6, ii, 1, v. 15), but to insist
that faith, like love, is valueless, if it has no effect on the life,
but expends itself in words. St. Paul himself does the same in
1 Thess. i. 3, Gal. V. 6, 1 Cor. xiii. 2, Rom. ii. 6-20, and indeed
throughout his Epistles; but in arguing against his ‹Judaizing
antagonists‚· who denied salvation to the Gentiles unless they were
circumcised and in all other respects performed ‘ the works of the
law,' he had maintained that it was impossible for men to be justified
by these works, and that it was by saith alone that even the Jews
and Abraham himself, no less than Gentiles, must be justified.
He therefore challenges the phrase of St. James ἡ πίστις χωρὶς
τῶν ἕρνγων α’ρτγή ἐστιν, νεκρά ἐστιν by a direct contradiction,
λογιζόμεθα Ὑὰρ δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς ἕρὙωυ νόμου,
in support of which he appeals (1) to Deut. xxvii. 26 ‘Cursed
is every one that continueth not in all things which are written
in the book of the law to do them,' as proving the absolute obedi-
ence required by the laW, Gal. iii. 10, (2) to the confession of the
Psalmist (xiv. cxliii. 2, cf. Rom. iii. 20, Gal. iii. 16) that ‘ by the
works of the law shall no flesh be justified‚' and to that of the
Preacher (iii. 20, cf. Rom. iii. 23) ‘there is not a just man upon
earth that doeth good and sinneth not.' If the contrary suppo-
