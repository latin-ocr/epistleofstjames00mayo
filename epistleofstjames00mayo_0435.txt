Ι. 1-15, Paraphrase.

Rcsoiec wheu you meet wale, trials (temptatiorzs) of whatever kind,
leuowiuy that these are desiyucd to prove your saith arad fia] iu you
the habit of patient eudurauec‚ with a view to your cettaiumcut of
the perfect Christian character. To wahe the riqht use of trial there
is need of wisdom, which must be souyht by prayer from Him who
qives frccly without upbraidiuq for past ucyleet or iugyratitudc.
[But prayer, to bc effectual, maist be the utteraucc of a ficccd purpose
which is iu uo dauycr of beiriy diverted by chariyiuy moods or cir-

rich, iu the fact that he has bceu taugffit the emptiuess of earthly wealth
aud station aud has learnt to aim at heaveuly riches,· siuee the rich
man of this world is doomed to pass away like the flowcr of the field]
Remcmbcr however that it is ποί trial iu itself, but thc patieut eu-

has been thus approved shall receive the crown of life promised to all
that love God. Lct uo orec say wheu he is temptcd (tried), that God is
the author of his temptatiou, for God, as hc is iueapablc of heiuy
tempted, so He tempts noue. Each mau is tempted by his own lust (im.-
pulsc), by which he is carried away from riyht aud allured to wrouy .·
lust, when it has couceived, becomes the parent of siu ; siu wheu
matured brinqs forth death.
