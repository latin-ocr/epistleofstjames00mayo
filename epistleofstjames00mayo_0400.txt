140 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἀποκερδήσω as fut. 01 the compound. The pass. fut. κερδηθήσομαι occurs
in 1 Pet. iii. 2. Dr. Plunnner calls attention to the repeated καί
separating ‘the different items of the plan, which are rehearsed thus
one by one with manifest satisfaction.'

14. οἵτινες οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τὸ τῆς αὕριον.] ‘ People that know not
(= ‘whereas ye know not,‘ Lat. qui ozon intelliqacz's) what belongs to
the 1norrow’3 or, reading τά with some MSS„ ‘the things of the
1norrow.' The phrase is in apposition with οἱ λέγοντες, as ἀνὴρ δίψυχος
with ὁ ἅνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος 111 1. 7, 8. For the neuter article cf. Matt. xxi.
21 τὸ τῆς συκῆς, 2 Pet. ii. 22 τὸ τῆς παροιμίας, Rom. viii. 5 τὰ τῆς
σαρκὸς φρονοῦσιν, XiV. 19 τὸ. τῆς εἰρήνης διώκομεν, 2 Cor. ii. 30. For
ellipse 01 ἡμέρας see WViner p. ¹738.l

ἀτμὶς γάρ ἐστε] Often used for smoke, as in ἆ. καμίνου Gen. xix. 28,
ἀ. καπνοῦ Acts ii. 17, ἀ. τ. θυμιάματος Ezek. viii. 11, elsewhere for steam
or breath as in Clem. Rom. 17 <a quotation, as Lightfoot suggests, from
Eldad and Modad) ἀτμὶς ἀπὸ κύθρας ‘steam from a kettle.’ It is
found in the versions of Symmachus and Aquila, where the Eng. has
‘vanity,’ as in Eccl. i. 2, ix. 9, xii. 8, Ps. xxxix. 5, lxii. 9, cxliv. 4,
Job vii. 16. For the thought see WVl'Sd. ii. 4 παρελεύσεται ὃ βίος ἡμῶν
ὡς ἴχνη νεφέλης καὶ ὡς ὀμίχλη διασκεδασθήσεται διωχθεῖσα ὑπὸ ἀκτίνων
ἡλίου, ib. v. 9-14 and passages quoted in Wetstein. The force 01 γάρ
here is to give significance to the preceding ποία. The reading ἐστε is
more vigorons than ἐστι, and may be compared with the substitution 01
ὁ πλούσιος 101· πλοῦτος 111 i. 10, where the thought is the same as here.

πρὸς ὀλίγον.] So Heb. Xii. 10 οἱ μὲν πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας ἐπαίδευον,
Apoc. XVii. 10 ὀλίγον αὐτὸν δεῖ μεῖναι.

ἔπειτα. καὶ ἀφανιζομένη] We might have expected ὕστερον δέ, bul] the
δέ 13 often omitted after ἔπειτα as in iii. 17, and the καὶ implies ‘ as it
appears), so also it disappears’ ι the character of our life is transiency.
Elsewhere in Ν .Τ. the verb denotes ‘to destroy’ 01· ‘to disfigure.' It
is used of an eclipse in Aristotle and Cleomedes, ancl generally of the
obscuration 01 the heavenly bodies in Pseudo-Aristotle de Mundo vi.
22 πᾶσα κινεῖται ἐνδελεχῶς ἐν κύκλοις ἰδίοις, ποτὲ μὲν ἀφανιζομένη ποτὲ δὲ
φαινομένη, μυρίας ἰδέας ἀναφαίνουσά τε καὶ πάλιν ἀποκρύπτουσα ἐκ μιᾶς
ἀρχῆς. Aristotle also uses it of the migration 01 birds (Ilia. An. vi. ’Τ
ὁ κόκκυξ φαίνεται ἐπ’ ὀλίγον χρόνον τοῦ θέρους, τὸν δὲ χειμῶνα ἀφανίζεται).

15. ἀντὶ τοῦ λέγειν ὑμᾶς] Cf. ΡΞ. cviii. 4 ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀγαπᾶν με ἐνδιέβαλλόν
με, and above iii. 3 εἷς τὸ πείθεσθαι, αὐτοὺς ἡμῖν, where see n. A

¹ WII. read here in their text οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τῆς αὔριον ποία ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν. ἀτμὶς
γάρ ἐστε πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη, agreeing with B except that the latter omits ἡ before
ζωή. This 3001113 to 1110 to give a harsh construction for the genitive, and also to
weaken the soree of the passage. The solly 01 boasting as to the mori-ow is naturally
exposed hy’pointing to our ignorance of what will huppen on the morrow, and this
is itself a consequence of the uncertainty of our life, appearing and disappearing like
a shifting mist. The mnis-sion ot' the lirst step confusos the expression. It was easy
for τό or τά to be lost before τῆς, mul then γάρ would be dropped in order to supply
smne sort of construction. signin, the weight of evidence seems to mein favour of
retaining ἡ before πρός <which also facilitates tho reading of Sin. ποία ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν ἡ
πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη). The dill'erence in numining made by the retentio„ of tho
article is that the tendency to appear and disnppear is made a property of the vapour,
not a incre aeuidental circumstance.
