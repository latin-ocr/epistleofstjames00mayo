1110111 writings showing 111111 it was the custom to send for a rabbi in sick-
11655, :md that 5011161111165 as many as four visited 1116 sick at one time.
Polycarp (ml Phil. 6) mentions visitation of the sick as a duty of
the 6111615 ἐπισκεπτόμενοι πάντας ἀσθενεῖς, seo Acts xx. 35. On the treat-

v. 9 ἐν ἀρρωστήματί σου...εῧξαι Κυρίῳ καὶ αὐτὸς ἰάσεταί σε.

προσευξάσθωσαν ἐπ’ αὐτόν] ‘ Let them pray (51161011111ἕ,γ their hands)over
him.' Origen (Ilum. in Lev. ii. 4) comparing the ways of propitiation
under 1116 old 111111 new covellantS, quotes this verse as follows si quis
autem infirmatem, vocet jn‘esltgyteros ecclesiae, et imponant ei ortanus,
weycntes eum in nomine Domini. 1ιέ oratio fidei salvabit ivfirmmn et,
si. in peccatis suerit, remittentur ei. Ι do not think this implies any
(16111111 of the beneficia] effect of oil in bodily sickness (115 Dr. Plummer

(1065 1101 care to dwell upon 11, as it 15 unconnected with his particular
subject. For the acc. cf. μὴ κλαίετε ἐπ’ ἐμέ Lilke xxiii. 28, ὀνομάζειν

are 11150 praised by Philo (Suum. M. i. 666), Pliny (KH. xxiii. 34-50),
and Galen (Med. Temp. bk. ii.>. The latter 011115 it ἄριστον ἰαμάτων
πάντων τοῖς ἐξηραμμένοις καὶ αὐχμώδεσι σώμασιν. Here the anointing is
accompanied by 11 111111101110115 healing in answer 10 prayer, as we
are told of the Twelve (Mark vi. 13) ἤλειφον ἐλαίῳ πολλοὺς ἀρρώσ-
τους καὶ ἐθεράπευον. Nothing 15 specified 115 10 1116 1156 of 011 in

(χαρίσματα ἰαμάτων) are mentioned along with the other manifestations
