To go now a little inore into detail, Von Soden tells us that
nothing is said of the Temple, the Worship, the Law. We
have seen that with regard to worship, a most important rule is
laid down, which implies the insignificance of tho Mosaic ritual
110 less than our Lord’s words ‘neither in this mountain nor
yet at Jerusalem? As to the Temple, one does not quite 560
how it could be introduced in a letter to Jews residing abroad,
unless it were to urge theni to send contributions inore regularly
or to coine up inore frequently to Jerusalem. But trivial details
of this sort would be entirely out of place in the exhortations
of one who may be best described as the living einbodinient of
the Sermon 0111116 Mount. As to the Law, how can it be said
to be ignored, when there is a distinct reference to the common
Jewish error, that you might pick and choose your favourite 00111-
mandment and confine your attention to that: ‘ Whoever offends
in a single point is guilty of the whole law 3 for he that said Thou
shalt not commit adultery‚ said also Thou shalt not kill'Z and
when in iv, 11 the Law appears as the representative of the Law-
giver and Judge 2 This conception of the Law, as the expression
of the mind and will of God, leads at once to its being regarded as
a Law of Liberty, the guiding principle of life, not the mere
written statute. Von Soden asks why St. James does not point
out that such a Law of Liberty was already recognized 111 1116 Old
Testament. The answer is that it was unnecessary, because the
very phrase would naturally recall to the 111111115 of 1115 Jewish
readers similar expressions 111 the Old Testament (see note 0111. 25),
and would also be felt to be in entire accordance with the ethical
teaehing of Christ, as contained in what we know as the Sermon
011 1116 11101101, and probably in the earliest summaries provided sor
the use of believers.

Lastly Von Soden asserts that Jewish Christians would never
liniit the sense of ἔργα 10 ‘ works of love ’ but would necessarily
include in it St. Paul's ‘works of the law? In the actual
passage in question (ii. 14-26) we need not limit ἕρνγα 10 works
of love, strictly speaking: the sacrifice of Isaac (ii. 21) could
hardly be described as such. They are ἕρνγα καλά 111 1116 widest
sense ; though they exhibit 110 doubt the joint action of saith and
love, if there is any meaning in the illustration from almsgiving
contained in vv. 15, 10, and any reference to the royal law of
