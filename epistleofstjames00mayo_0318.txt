⁴30 ΤΠΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

the existing luanifestation of the Spirit is described as a mere
ἀπαρχή in comparison with what shall be hereafter, ‘ the glorious
liberty of the children of God ' : in Apoc. xiv. 4 the 144‚000 are called
ἀπαρχὴ τῷ Θεῷ καὶ τῷ Ἀρνίῳ, Cf. the ἐκκλησία πρωτοτόκων Of Heb. xii. 23.
In the Clementine Homilies (i. 3) Peter speaks of Clement as τῶν
σωζομένων ἐθνῶν ἀπαρχή. Τινά = Lat. quidam, ‘as ib were,’ marks thal}
the word is used not strictly, but metaphorically. Κτισμάτωνε cf.
Wisd. xiii. 4 ἐκ καλλονῆς κτισμάτων ἀναλόγως ὃ γενεσιουργὸς θεωρεῖται.
'she writer uses the widest possible word, embracing not only Christians,
but mankind in general, who were blessed in Abraham and still more
in Christ5 not only nien, but all created things: cf. Rom. viii. 19-22,
the παλιγγενεσία of Matt. xix. 28, the prophecies of Isa. xi. 6 foll„
lxv. 13. The position of αὐτοῦ is unusual: cf. 1 Pet. i. 3 ὁ κατὰ τὸ
πολὺ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς, 1 John ii. 5 ὃς δ’ ἂν τηρῇ αὐτοῦ τὸν
λόγον, ver. 27 τὸ αὐτοῦ χρίσμα διδάσκει ἡμᾶς, 2 Pet. i. 9 τῶν πάλαι
αὐτοῦ ἁμαρτιῶν, in all of which there is an emphasis on the pronoun.

19. tem] ‘ All this you know : act upon your knowledge. Since it
is through the word we are begotten anew, let us listen to it in meek-
neSS‚ instead of being so eager to give utterance to our own opinions.
Do not think that overbearing fanaticism is in accordance with the
will of God, or that fierce argumentation is the way to recommend
God's truth.’ Cf. below iii. 1 foll. with notes. We find the same
appeal to the knowledge of the reader in i. 3, iii. 1. The form ἴστε is
found elsewhere in N.T. only in Eph. v. 5 and Heb. xii. 17, οἴδατε being
ordinarily used, as below iv. 4. It might be taken as an imperative ‘ be
sure of thiS‚' but I prefer to take it as indicative, as in Eph. v. 5 and
Heb. xii. 173 cf. γινώσκετε below, V. 20.

πᾶς civemn-os] This individualizing phrase is often found instead of
πάντες in N .T.‚ cf. John i. 9, ii. 10 πᾶς ἅνθρωπος πρῶτον τὸν καλὸν οἶνον
τίθησι, Gal. v. 3, Col. i. 28 (thrice).

ταχὺς εἰς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι.] For this use of εἷς τό cf. 1 Thess. iv. 9 θεοδίδακτοί
ἐστε εἰς τὸ ἀγαπᾶν ἀλλήλους, and such instances of the simple acc. after
εἷς as Luke xii. 21 εἷς τὸν Θεὸν πλουτῶν, Rom. xvi. 19 σοφοὺς μὲν εἷς τὸ
ἀγαθόν, ἀκεραίους δὲ εἰς τὸ κακόν. For the thought cf. Sir. ii. 29 μὴ
γίνου ταχὺς (al. τραχὺς) ἐν γλώσσῃ σου, καὶ νωθρὸς ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις σου, ib.
V. ll γίνου ταχὺς ἐν ἀκροάσει σου καὶ ἐν μακροθυμίᾳ. φθέγγου ἀπόκρισιν, ib.
xx. 4, Prov. x. 19, xiii. 3, 11, xxix. Eccl. v. 1, 2, Taylor Jewislz Fatlcers,
p. 104, Zeno ap. Diog. L. vii. 23 διὰ ταῦτα δύο ὦτα ἔχομεν στόμα δὲ ἓν,
ἵνα πλείω μὲν ἀκούωμεν ἥττονα δὲ λαλῶμεν, DemonaX ap. Luc. ξ 51 (asked
how one would best rule, he said) ἀόργητος καὶ ὀλίγα μὲν λαλῶν πολλὰ δὲ
ἀκούων, Bias μίσει τὸ ταχὺ λαλεῖν, μὴ ἁμάρτῃς, (quoted with other maxims
of the kind in Mullach’s Fray. Phil. i. p. 212 foll).

βραδὺς εἰς ὀργήν.] Ov. Ea· Ponto i. 2. 121 pisser (ιιΖ poenas, ad praemia
velat, Philo M. 1. p. 412 βραδὺς ὠφελῆσαι, ταχὺς βλάψαι, ib· ii· p· 522

βραδεῖς μὲν ὄντες τὰ καλὰ παιδεύεσθαι, τὰ δ’ ἐναντία μανθάνειν ὀξύτατοι.

For thought cf. iii. 9, 14-16, iv. 1, 2, 11, Prov. xvi. 32, Eccles. vii. 9
μὴ σπεῦσῃς ἐν πνεύματί σου τοῦ θυμεῖσθαι.

20. ὀργὴ γὰρ-ἑργάζεται.] Sir. i. 19 οὐ δυνήσεται θυμώδης ἀνὴρ (al-
θυμὸς ἄδικος) δικαιωθῆναι, Psa. cvi. 32, 33 (of Bloses at Meribah). For
