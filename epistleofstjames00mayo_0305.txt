loose quotation, representing some of the verses cited above on στέφανος,
such as we find below iv. 5. For the. latter view it may be said that it
15 apparently the same quotation which 15 repented in different words
below ii. 5. For the former, that the undoubted references 10 the
Sermon on the Mount which occur in this epistle are in all probability
actual reminiscens-es of spoken words, not copied from the written
Gospel3 and secondly, that it seems 6115161Ί to explain the coincidence
between St. James and the writer of the Apocalypsc 1111 this than on
any other supposition. Promises to those that love God are found 111

2 Tim. iv. 8, l Cor. ii. 9 (a quotation from 1511. lxiv. 4, where however
the LXX. has τοῖς ὑπομένουσιν ἔλεον foi· St. Paul's τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν).

the nearer cause expressed by ὑπό <1Υ1116η p. 463 foll). Eve was the
immediate cause of Adam's transgression, but Adam tried to make God

So the fault is often laid on hereditary dislosition, on unfavourable
circumstances, on sudden and overpowering πειρασμός. The same plea
is noticed in both Jewish and heathen writers: cf. Prov. xiX. 3 ἀφρο-
