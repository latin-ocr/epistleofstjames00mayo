ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxi

Origen is the first to mention the epistle, without however accepting its
genuinench as is evident from his comment on Matthcw xiii. 55, in which he
gives some account of the Lord's brothers and refers to the cpistle of Jude, but
not to that of James.

What is to be said when people, who oughtto know better, make
statements of this sort ἲ Ι can only refer my readers to my chapter
on the External Evidence for the Authenticity of the Epistle, and
ask whether the quotations there given from Clement of Rome and
others are not sufficient evidence that our Epistle was known in the
first eentury; whether the quotations from Ignatius, Polycarp‚
J nstin Martyr‚ the Ep. ad Diognetum, Irenaeus‚ above all Hermas,
are not such as to prove that our Epistle was studied by these writers
in the second century ; whether any 0116 with the sniallest particle
of historical sense or literary feeling could for a moment dream
that the author of 1116 Shepherd was prior 10, 01 contemporary with,
the writer of our Epistle; whether the fact that Origen, having
other things of more interest to 1611 about St. James, omits to
mention that he wrote this Epistle (as he also omits to mention
that he presided over the Council at Jerusalem), while he mentions
the Epistle of St. Jude, because about St. Jude he has nothing else
to tell—whether, I say, this fact gives the slightest ground for
supposing that Origen doubted the authority of an Epistle, which
he over and over again cites as Scriptum, and as written by J ames,
the brother of the Lord.

Let us hear next what Von Soden has to say on 1110 relation of
our Epistle to other books of the New Testament.

The writer is acquainted with the epistle to the Romans and the first epistle
to the Corinthians. The tone is similar to that in the Hebrews, though there
is 110 literary connexion between them. On the other hand it is partly copied
from the lst of Peter. The isolated resemblances to the Apocalypse prove
nothing. It is closely connected with the Gospel and Acts of Luke, having
the same Ebionite leaning‚ and giving the words of Christ in the same form,
while there seems no trace of the special tradition of Matffiew, such as we find
in section v. 17-vi. 13 of his Gospel (except for the injunction as to swearing).
There is however no direct copying from the Gospels. With the writings ot'
John there is no kind of connexion. The writer is acquainted with the
LXX„ but betrays no knowledge of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.
He 15 well acquainted with the sapiential books of the Apocrypha and with
Philo. There are also signs of his having some knowledge of Greek literature.

Here too the conclusions arrived at seem to me entirely at vari-
ance with the facts, as Ι think will be apparent to any one who will
ponder what has been said in my chapter on the Relation of the
