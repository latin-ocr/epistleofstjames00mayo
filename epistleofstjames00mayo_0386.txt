126 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

it is therefore allowable in all cases to substitute the word ‘ murder' for
‘ hate? In the present case it may be safely said that no sane writer,
no one who had the slightest feeling for rhetorical effect (and St. J ames
is both emincntly sane and eminently rhetorical) could have used
φονεύετε in the sense of μισεῖτε before ζηλοῦτε. There is no reason here
to lay an exaggerated stress on the idea of hate, if nothing more than
hate is intended: not only cloes it make a mere bathos of ζηλοῦτε, but
it weakens the force of the following μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε. Others
have thought it impossible that those addressed by St. James could
be guilty of the actual sin of murder. But in ch. V. 6 we read ἐφονεύ-
σατε τὸν δίκαιον, So 1 Pet. iv. 15 μὴ γάρ τις ὑμῶν πασχέτω ὡς φονεὺς ἢ
κλέπτης ὴ κακοποιός, and Didache iii. 2 μὴ γίνου ὀργίλος...μηδὲ ζηλωτὴς
μηδὲ ἐριστικὸς μηδὲ θυμικός· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἁπάντων φόνοι γεννῶνται, and
I think we should gather from Acts xxi. 20 that some of the assailants
of St. Paul at Jerusalem were members of the Christian community.
Of (2) it is sufficient to say that there is no evidence of the verb ζηλόω
being used in this sense, and nothing to suggest it in the G.T. use of
the word ζηλωτής. (3) If ζηλοῦτε preceded φονεύετε, something might
be said for the theory of ἓν διὰ δυοῖνε as it is, every one must feel
that it is a suggestion of despair.

Lasffly, Alford, Bouman, Schegg and others, feeling the unsatisfactory
nature of the above-mentioned explanations, have fallen back on the
literal rendering. Schegg is the only commentator known to me who
makes any attempt to account for the order of the words, which he
defends as fellows: ‘ Die Lust beqelcret, d. h. sie sucht werkth'atig zu
erreichen, wornach sie geliistet3 die Lust tolet, d. h. sie schafft gewalt-
sam bei seite was ihr hinderlieh entgegentritt 3 die Lust rinyet um das,
was sie zu erlangen im Begriffe ist...Da toten uncl ringen verschiedene
Objekte haben, indem sich t'oten qeyen, ringen auf etwas richtet, so
hat Jakobus psychologisch richtig die Reihen-und-Stufenfolge der
Aeusserungen des Geliistens eingehalten.' It is by no means certain
that ζηλοῦτε is to be taken here in the sense, which Schegg assigns to
it, of striving after a thing ; it is often followed by an accusative of the
person. But supposing it to be true that the object of ζηλοῦτε is here
a thing, and that of φονεύετε a person, I am unable to see why this
makes it psychologically right to put φονεύετε first. Surely it is the
resistance to our effort to gain an object which suggests to us the
necessity of moving the obstacle out of the way.

I have for many years held the opinion that, assuming the correct-
ness of the text, the only way to interpret it is to place a colon after
φονεύετε : and I am glad to find that the same idea has occurred to Dr.
J. Chr. K. v. Hofmann, whose couimentary appeared in 1876. It is
also given as an alternative reading in Westcott and Hort’s edition
(1881). The easiest way of seeing how the words naturally group
themselves is to put them side by sido without any stopping: ἐπιθυμεῖτε
καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν μάχεσθε καὶ
πολεμεῖτε. Can any one doubt that the abrupt collocations of φονεύετε
and μάχεσθε are employed to express results of what precedes, and that
in the second series ζηλοῦτε καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν correspond to ἐπιθυ-
