ii. 24 πέποιθα ἐν τῷ Κυρίῳ ὅτι...ἐλεύσομαι, but elsewhere we find St.
Paul speaking of his future plans without the use of any such phrase,
eg. Acts xix. 21, Rom. XV. 28, 1 Cor. xvi. 5. A similar phrase was
customary with the Greeks and Romans, cf. Arist. Pluc. 114 οἶμαι

17. εἰδότι οὖν] ‘So it seems, if one knows to do good and does it
not, there is guilt to him? The verse sums up all that has been said
before, going back as far as i. 22, ii. 14, iii. 1, 13, iv. 11. Instead of
