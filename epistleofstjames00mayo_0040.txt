(5) I take next two minor identifications, that of ‘James the

¹2¹ less' with 1110 ‘brother of the Lord‚' and that of Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου,
ι’ of Luke vi. 16 01111 Αο15 i. 13, with Jude the writer of the Epistle‚

0 *e ‘ro ujf who calls himself ‘ brother of James.’ We have seen that Mary

ου’ a} the mother of James τοῦ μικροῦ and of Joses, in Mark xv. 40, is

w ι ww probably the same as Mary of Clopas‚ and that we have 00 reason

ιο for inferi-ing from the Gospels that she was related to J esus. If 50,

there is 011 91111 10 1119 supposition that James the less is James
the brother of the Lord. But it is worth while to notice the
mistranslation in which Jerome imagined that he found a further
argument for the identification of our James with the son of
Alphaeus. The comparative intuor, he says, suggests two persons,
viz. the two Apostles of this name. But the Greek has no com—
parative, simply τοῧ μικροῦ, ⁴ the little‚' which no more implies a
comparison with only one person, than any other descriptive
epithet‚ such as εὐεργέτης 01 φιλάδελφος. Α5 10 Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου,
110 instance is cited for such an omission of the word ἀδελφός, and
we must therefore translate ‘Judas son of James’ with the RV.
lndependently of this, if James, Judas and Simon are all sons of
Alphaeus, what a strange way is this of introducing their names 111
1119 1151 of the Apostles, ‘ J ames of Alphaeus, Simon Zelotes‚ J udas
of ι1011195 ’ 1 Why not speak of all as ‘ 50115 of Alphaeus‚' or of the
two latter as ‘ brothers of James'2 Why not speak of all as
‘brethren of the Lord'? It is especially strange that, if Judas
were really known as such, he should have been distinguished 111
John (xiv, 22) merely by a negative, ‘Judas not Iscariot,' and in
the other Gospels by the appellation ‘Lebbaeus' or ‘Thaddaeus’
(Matt. x. 3, Mark iii. 18).

(6) Much has been made of the identification of the names
Alphaeus and 0101105, and of the duality of Clopas and Cleopas
(Luke xxiv. 18). It seems doubtful whether the identification of
the former and the separation of the latter pair 000 be maintained.
Bp. Lightfoot considers that ‘ viewing the question as one of names
only, it is quite as reasonable to identify Clopas with Cleopas as
with Alphaeus ' (l.e.‚ pp. 256, 267). Supposing our previous argu-
ment to be 5011011, 1119 question is of no importance as to our main
subject. 1f however we extend our inquiry beyond the limits of
the NT. it again becomes a matter of interest, because we learn
from Hegesippus (about 160 AD.) that there was a connexion of a
