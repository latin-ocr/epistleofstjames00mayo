ccxxvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

2. Speculum (m). This is a common-place book of texts arranged
under different heads, wrongly ascribed to St. Augustino. F irst
printed by Cardinal Mai in the Now I'ulrum Bibliotheca vol. i. pt. 2.
The latest edition is that by Weihrich in the 0073). Scr. Eccl. Lat.
Vienna, 1887, from which the transcript below is taken. Prof.
Sanday in his review of Weihrich (Class. Κατ. iv, 414 foll.) notices
the close resemblance between the readings in the Speculum and
those in the writings of Priscillian edited in the same series by
Schepss in 1889 from a MS. of the Gth century. I have therefore
placed in the same column with the quotations from the Speculum
those from

3. Priscillian (died 385 A.D.). Dr. Sanday is of opinion that
the Spcculum ‘ was put together somewhere in the circle in which
Priscilh‘an moved, and from a copy of the Bible, which, if not
exactly his, was yet closely related to it? I have distinguished
the quotations from those in the Speculum by inclosing them in
square brackets. Dr. Schepss (p. 17) had already compared Pris-
cillian's version of J ames v. 1 foll. with that given in the Speculum.

II. Vulgate (Vulg.).

1 Coclca· Amwtinus. Written probably at Jarrow about the end
of the seventh century,1 and sent as a present to Rome by Ceolfrid
in 716 A.D. 3 printed by Tischendorf in 1850 and 1854. Contains
the whole Latin Bible with the exception of the book of Baruch.
In the notes I have mentioned where it differs from the Coelen:
Fulcicusis, written in the same century, and from the genuine
Speculum of St. Augustine, edited with the other Speculum by

Weihrich.

Lau. denotes the consensus of the Latin versions.

B. Syriae.

1. Pesla. The Peslzz'tto (ie. ‘ simple ³) version contains the whole
Bible with the exception of the ‘2nd epistle of Peter, 2nd and 3rd

St. Matthew and St. Mark, and is transcribed by Tischcndorf in the ‘ Anzeige-Blatt’
to the Wiener Jalzrhiicher of 1847, 8, 9. 1 have not been able to see any transcript
of the fragments from St.. James, which Tischcndorf denotes by the letter (3) ; but
it would scum from his critical notes that it is generally in agreement with the
Vulgate against θοι-1). and Spec. [Since the above was written, I have been enabled,
through the kindness of Prof. Sanday, to make a copy os Belsheiiu's transcript of
this Codex. See postscript below]
