V 12-20 CONFEssION OF SIN 221

of visiting the sick is not confined to them, but falls 011 the brethren
generally. Are we to understand that no one may hear the con-
fession of others unless he at the same time confesses his sins to
them? This would seem the most natural meaning 01 the Greek,
but it evidently could not be always carried out. Children ought to
confess their faults to father or mother, but it would in most cases be
far from expedient that the former should in their turn hear the
confessions of the latter. On the other hand we can easily conceive
cases in which mutual confession is most natural and desirable, since
one party is seldom so entirely in the right, as to leave all the regrets
and apologies to the other party. If however we are to think of
confession here in connexion with healing, it must be the confession of
sin against God which is intended: how would this suit the idea of
mutual confession? We can understand that confession is made easier
to the sinner, if another is ready to join 111 the expression of sorrow
and repentance. We can understand too that an unsympathizing
Pharisaic tone is likely to repel any confidences 011 the part of a
penitent. But the idea of mutual confession does not seem altogether
appropriate in the case of the sick man, and yet, if the word ἰαθῆτε 15
taken literally, we seem to be tied down to this case. If on the other
hand we give it a metaphorica] meaning, we may suppose that the
precept is of general application, and that St. J ames is recommending
the habit of mutual confession between friends. It cannot, Ι think,
be doubted that in many respects such mutual confidences might be
productive of great good. How much easier it would be to put up
with hastiness or coldness 011 the part of a friend, if we knew that 116
was himself conscious of his faults and trying to amend them l What
a relief it would be to one of a sensitive self-conscious nature to lay his
anxieties before another of whose wisdom and sympathy he 16111
assui-ed! Might it not tend to increase the feeling of Christian
fellowship‚ if those who were exposed to the same difficulties, anxious
to conquer the same weaknesses and to practise the same virtues,
could break through their isolation and confirm themselves in their
good resolutioris by the knowledge that they were shared by others?
Might it not help to diminish the miseries of life, and to change the
course of thoughts which may be tending towards insanity or suicide,
if there were more of outspoken sympathy in the world, if people were
sure that they might trust their secret feelings to others without fear
of being despised or laughed at or shrunk from‘l The Church of
England has wisely refused to follow Rome in requiring regular
confession to the priest3 yet, where the parish priest is what he
should be, wise with the heavenly wisdom described by St. James,
none should be better fitted than he by position, training, and ex-
perience, to receive such confidences and give the needed comfort and
counsel.1

On the whole of this section of the Epistle it may be worth while
to quote Dr. Arnold's remarks ‘³ :—
