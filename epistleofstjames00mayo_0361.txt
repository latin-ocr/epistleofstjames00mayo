III 1-3 NOTES 101

οὗτος τέλειος ἀνήμ] οὗτος marks the apodosis as in i. 23. For ἀνήρ see
above i. 83 for τέλειος i. 4.

χαλιναγωγῆσαι] See On i. 26, and cf. Philo M. l. p. 196 (the true
man within each) ἐπιστομίζων ταῖς τοῦ συνειδότος ἡνίαις τὸν αὐθάδη καὶ
μετὰ ἀφηνιασμοῦ δρόμον γλώττης ἐπέσχεν, ib. p. 314.

καὶ ὅλον τὸ croam] Repe-ared in VV. 3 and 6. The figure of χαλ. is
further carried out : by the bridle in the mouth we turn the horse as
we will, so by controlling our words we can regulate our whole
activity. We find the opposition of one member to the whole body,
Matt. v, 29.

3, ἴδε] WH. with RV. and all the recent editors (except Hofmann
and Bassett, who keep ἴδε) read εἰ δέ. The evidence is as follows : AB
with some inferior MSS. read ΕΙΔΕ, Vulg. and Corb. si autem ,· Sin.
ΕΙΔΕ ΓΑΡ, Sinf· omits γάρ,· Cod. Ephr. with many inferior MSS. and
Theophyl. and Euth. Zig. in comment ΙΔΕ 3 Pesh. ecce enim ,· Egyptian,
Ethiopian and later Syriae versions ecce. The confusion between ει
and 1. being extremely common,1 it is important to observe (l) that the
insertion of γὰρ in Sin. seems to show that the preceding ειδε must be
taken as an imperative 3 (2) that this view is supported by some of the
oldest versions 3 (3) that as regards B in particular, since it ‘shows
a remarkable inclination to change ι into ει’ (WH. Introduction, p.
306), its evidence here is of little weight.‘2 We have therefore to fall
back on other considerations : and it is plain that εἰ δέ is not suited to
the context. ‘ If a man does not stumble in word he is able to bridle
his whole body. And if we put the bits into the horses’ mouths that
they may obey us,—we turn about their whole body also.’ The natural
apodosis to such a protasis would be ‘let us also for the same purpose
put a bridle in our own lips.' The present apodosis adds nothing to
the clause εἷς τὸ πείθεσθαι, and it is difficult to find any natural meaning
for δέ at the beginning of the verse: even the καί in apodosis is out of
place 3 it would have been natural if the protasis had run εἰ τὸ στόμα
μετάγομεν. Lastly‚ the καί after ἰδού in ver. 4 seems to look back
to the preceding ἴδε. De Wette and Beyschlag felt these difficulties
so strongly that they included the whole verse in the protasis and
explained the construction as an aposiopesis. Thus the latter trans-
lates ‘ Wenn wir aber den Pferden die Ziigel in die Mauler legen um
sie gehorsam zu machen‚ und so ihren ganzen Leib regieren‚ so sollten
wir es doch auch uns selbst thun, d.h. auch unserer Zunge einen Ziigel
anlegen und so unseres ganzen Leibes sittlich machtig werden ⁷ 3 and
refers, for examples of aposiopesis after εἰ, to Luke xiX. 42, Acts xxiii. 9,
Mark vii. 11, which however are very unlike the present. In fact such

1 Field compares Rom. ii. 17, where the old reading ἴδε σὺ Ἰουδαῖος has been
changed to εἶ δέ by late editors, niisled by the spelling of the majority of the uncial
MSS„ as in our text, aud with equally disastrous effect on the construction. He
points out that Sin. has εἴδου for ἵδου in Luke xxiii. 15, εἴδετε for ἴδετε Luke xxiv.
39, 1 John iii. 1. Below v. 11 the MSS. are nearly equally divided between ἴδετε
and εἴδετε. In Luke vi. 3 Cod. D has εἶδε for ἴδε.

² In this epistle B gives ει not only for long ι, as γειιώσκοντες, θλείψει, ῥειπιζομένῳ,
εἷός, but occasionally for short ι, as ἀνθρωπείνῃ, ἀτμείς. So C has σοφείας i. 5.
