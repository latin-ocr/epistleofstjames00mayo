j In writiny my Preface I brin9 to a close a worlc which has for

some years been ‘my chief occupatiori, and which has indeed been

Epistle to be the earliest of the books of the New Pammeni, written
j probably in the fifth decade of the Christian cra by one who had

been broicqlit up with Jesus from his childhood and whose teachiny

seldom out of my thouyhts since the time when, as an underyraduatc,
I first made acquaintance with Colcridqe's Aids ‘co Reflection, and

was led in consequence to stucly with some care the Epistle of St.

     

is in many points identical with the actual words of our Lord as
Irecorded in the Synoptic Gospels. If I am not mistakcn, it presente

interestiny historicallgs, but is likely to be of special value in an aye

to us a picture os pre—Pauline Christianity, which is not only

of reliyious doubt and anxiety lilce the present. Anzonyst those
to whom the formulas os later Christianity have lost or are losiny
their siqnificance, there must be many who will find a messaqe suited
'⁸ to them in the lanyuaye of this, the least technical of all the Epistles,
‘many who will appreciate the strong] practical sense and earnest

philanthropys of St. James, and take to hcart his warninys aqainst
