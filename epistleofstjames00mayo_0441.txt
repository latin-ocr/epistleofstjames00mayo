I l—15 πειρασμός-πειράζεσθαι ’ 181

in circumstances which it was impossible to contend against. St.
J ames meets this in two ways : (1) by showing that it involves a sup-
position which contradicts what we know of God, (2) by explaining
more fully the nature of intel-nal temptation. (1) (α) God is untempt-
able; (b) He tempts none. But how are these statements to be recon-
ciled with other passages of scripture, in which God is said both to be
tempted and to tempt‘} Such are Ex. xvii. 2 ‘ why do ye tempt (πειρά-
ζετε) the Lord 2 ' ver 7 ‘he called the name of the place Massah (πειρασ-
μόν) because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us or
not‘l' Numbers xiV. 22, Deut. vi. 16 ‘ye shall not tempt the Lord‚'
Ps. lxxviii. 18, 41, xcv. 9, Isa. vii. 12, Matt. iv. 7, where our Lord
meets the temptation to cast himself down from the temple by referring
to the command in Dent. vi. 16, Acts v. 9 (of Ananias and Sapphira)
⁶ how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the
Lord 2² 1 Cor. X. 9 ‘neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also
tempted and were destroyed of serpents' (referring to Numb. xxi. 5
‘ the people spake against God and against Moses, Wherefore have ye
brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness‘l')‚ cf. Judith viii.
12 (of the rash oath of Ozias to surrenderBethulia if help did not come
within five days) ί who are ye that have tempted God2 . . . ye cannot
find out the depth of the heart of man, then how can ye search out
God or comprehend his purposeZ . . . He hath power to defend us when
he will. Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our Orod? So 5611-
sought martyrdom and the proposal to test the power of prayer by
comparing the results in a praying and in a non-praying hospital may
in different ways be regarded as tempting God. The distinction is
plain between the temptation to sin of which St. James speaks and
such cases as these, in which :men are said to tempt God, when they
make experiments with Him, or take liberties with Him, try how far
they may go, so to spe-ak, instead of humbly submitting to what they
feel to be His revealed will or His providential ordei-ing 3 when in the
words of Stier they ‘anticipate by the word of their own self—will the
word of God upon which they should wait.⁷ Man can be tempted
because of the propensity to evil in his own nature 3 God cannot be
tempted because He is absolute goodness.

But (b) we also read of God tempting man, as where he tested
Abraham's obedience by demanding the sacrifice of his son (Gen. xxii.
1), or the Israelites by the forty years' wandering ‘to humble thee,
and to prove thee (πειράσῃ), to know what was in thine heart‚’ Deut.
viii, 2, or Hezekiah by the Babylonian embassy 2 Chron. xxxii. 31,
J uclith viii. 25-27. But here again the design of temptation is quite
different from that spoken of in the text 3 it is not temptation with
the view of drawing man into sin, but trial with the view of dis-
covering his motives and principles and of gradually building up the
perfect Christian character, as stated in the second verse.

What then is the real history of the temptation which allures
us to 51111 It has its root in man himself, in his appetites, desires
and impulses of every sort, suggesting the thought of pleasure to
be obtained (or pain avoided) by the commission of a wrong act.
