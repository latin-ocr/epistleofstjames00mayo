cxxx THE EPISTLE oF ST. ,IAMES

The earliest history contains no clear trace of such churches widely
scattered through the lands.' In answer we may say that un-
doubtedly there must have been such churehes previously to the
admission of Gentiles into the Church, otherwise than as proselytos.
lt was to persecute such a church that Saul went to Damascus
with authority from the high priest. Such were all churches ,
t'mmded before the conversion of Cornelius, and the great majority
of churches founded before 51, except those founded by St. Paul.
There is just as little point in Dr. Davidson's further remark that
⁶ the writer does not convey the impressiou that his knowledge of
their condition was minute or specific, sor his language is general,
such as a late author, writing in his name, would employ.' Of
course a circular letter cannot deal with personal relations. Dr.
Davidson then states his own conclusion that it was written after
J ames's death, in his name, by a moderate Ebionite, shortly before
the destruction of Jerusalem. One does not quite see why the χ
moderate Ebionite should have been capable of writing in 68 the
letter which we have been just told it was impossible for St. J ames ¹
to have written six years before. If the moderate Ebionite ‘ occupied
a spiritual stage which Jaines the Just hardly reached,’ should we
not ‘naturally expect some mention of Christ's resurrection at
least'? But these men in buckram, who are always at the dis-
posal of our modern eritics, are worulerfully Protean in their
characteristics as in their powers.

νξΐζιῇξῖζξῖἳξ Let us turn, however, from ‘the halting and hesitating disciple,

3³55}ssssssssssssss with his intervals of English common-sense, to the uncom-

Elssgttffieffl.e promising idealism and superiority to fact of the German

‘'PRJ'Jt‘ssfm school, to whose guidance he has surrendered himself. We

may take Von Soden as one of the latest representatives of the
school. Here is asummary of his Introduction to our Epistle, so
far as it relates to its date and authenticity, which is con-
tained in the Hand-Iffimmentcw‘ zum Ν. Τ., brought out under the
direction of Professors Holtzmann‚ Lipsius, and others, in 1890 ;--

In thought and expression there is considerable resemblance between our
epistle and the writings of Clelnent of Rome, and especially of Hermas. There
is however no reason to suppose any literary connexion between them. They
resemble one another, simply because they were produced under the same con-
ditions. This view is confirmed by the fact that no trace of our epistle is to
be found throughout the 2nd century. Hegesippus knows nothing osan ·
epistle of Jaines. The supposed reininiscences in Clement of Alexandria are
just as likely to be reininiscences of Philo or Peter or Clenient of Rome.
