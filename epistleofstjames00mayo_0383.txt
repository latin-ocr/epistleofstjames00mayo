ib.Xii.18 δεσπόζων’ ισχύος ἐν ἐπιεικεία κρίνεις, Ρ11110 M. 0..p 112 (of God)
δια την σύμφυτον’ επιείκειαν καὶ φιλανθρωπίαν. It ls the Greek equiValent
to the Roman clementia (App. BC. ii. 106). Τ110 history of the word
shows that it is etymologically connected with εἰκός, implying that
which is fit and reasonable3 but its later meaning was influenced by
the idea of a connexion with εἵκω ‘to yield,⁷ iniplying one who does not
stand on his rights, but is ready to give way to the wishes of others.

εὐπειθής.] Not found elsewhere in NT. It is often used of military
discipline, as in 4 Mace. 8 6, Jos. Β. J. ii. 20. 7. We find it with a gen.
Plato Ley. i. 632 Β εῧπ. τῶν νόμων, with a (1· ·.ι1 ib. vii. 801 εὐπ. τοῖς
νόμοις, with pler ib. Vi. 718 O βουλοίμην ἂν αυτοὺς ὡς εὐπειθεστάτους
πρὸς ἀρετὴν ειναι. 111 1110 last passage it should probably be translated
⁶ easily to be persuaded,' as it follows the words ‘our exposition of the
laW’ τὰ μὲν πείθουσα, τὰ δὲ μὴ ὑπείκοντα πειθοῖ... βία κολάζουσα, τὴν πόλιν
εὐδαίμονα ἀποτελεῖ. So Philo M. 2. p. 378 διδασκαλίαι εἶσὶ τοὺς μὲν εὐπει-
θεῖς μαλακώτερον ἀναπείθουσαι, τοὺς δὲ ἀπαθεστέρους ἐμβριθέστερον. Τ110
opposite ἀπειθής, ἀπειθεῖν, ἀπείθεια occur several times in N.T. in the
sense of ‘disobedience.' Musonius (ap. Stob. ΕΟΖ. p. 453, Peerlkamp
Fraq. p. 227), answering the question whether obedience to a father is
always right, says that 110 310110 is to be called εὐπειθής who willingly
submits to a true fathcrly will (ὁ τῷ τὰ προσήκοντα παραινοῦντι κατήκοος
ὢν καὶ ἑπόμενος ἑκουσίως, οὗτος εὐπειθής). As ἐπιεικής refers mainly 1ο
one in a superior position, so I should understand εὐπειθής 10 refer to
an inferior, and translate ‘submissive,' ⁴ docile,' ‘tractable,⁷ old English
⁴ buxom,’ Lat. moriye‘ra. The quarrels and rivalries in the Ohurch were
due to faults on the side of the latter as well as of the former.

μεστὴ ἐλέους καὶ καρπῶν timuerim] See above vers. 8, 11. 13.

ἀδιάκριτος.] Here only in Nsr. The meaning of ὃιακρίνομαι above (i. 6,
ii. 4) makes it probable that we must understand the adj. here in the
sense of ‘ whole-hearted ' (undivided), as in Heracleon ap. Ol·ig.C0mm. in.

παιδεῖαι Σαλομῶντος αἱ ἀδιάκριτοι, where it seems to have a secondary
passive sense ‘ the undoubted proverbs.’ More commonly it means
‘ undistinguishable,' and hence ‘confused,' ⁴ vague,' as in Polyb. xv. 12. 9
ἀδιάκριτος φωνή ( promiscuus clamor Schw), Epict. Diss. i. 16. 12, ib. ii. 20.

μάστιξ ἆδ. ‘ indiscriminate punishment ' : Lucian ιῙιιῙ). Τταρ. 25 has
ἀμφήριστον ἔτι καὶ ἀδιάκριτον καταλιπὼν τὸν λόγον ‘leaving the matter
undecided,’ almost the opposite force to that which it bears here.

ἀνυπόκριτος.] ‘Unfeigned,' ‘ genuine,’ used of love 1 Pet. i. 22 τὰς
