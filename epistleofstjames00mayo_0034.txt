ἀδελφός being used 10 (1511015 5 50115111. In Latin flacco· may
stand for soum· patruelia where there is no danger of being 11115-
understood (cf. Cic. ad Aac. i. 5. 1). The Hebrew word is used
loosely to include cousin, as in Gen. xiV. 14—16 (of Abraham and
Lot), where the LXX. has ἀδελφιδοῦς ; 111 Levit. X. 4, where the first
cousins of Aaron are called brethren (ἀδελφοί) of his sons, Nadab
and Abihu3 in 1 Chron. xxiii. 21, 22 (‘ The sons of Mami, Eleazar
and Kish. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and
their brethren the sons of Kish took them ⁵), where also the LXX.
has ἀδελφοί. These passages seem to me 10 be hardly covered by
the general rule laid down by Bishop Lightfoot (p. 261): “in an affec—
tionate and earnest appeal intended to move the sympathies of the
hearer, a speaker might not unnaturally address a relation or a
friend or even a fellow-countryman as his ‘brother’: and even
when speaking of such to a third person he might through warmth
of feeling and under certain aspects 50 designate him.'' I think,
however, the Bishop is entirely right when he goes 011 10 say : “ It
is scarcely conceivable that the cousins of any one should be
commonly and indeed exclusively styled his ‘brothers' by in-
different persons; still less, that 0115 50115111 111 particular should be
singled 0111 and described in this loose way ‘James‚ the Lord's
brother.”' If we remark too the care with which Hegesippus
(quoted under ξ 6 below) employs the term ἀδελφός of 5511155 and
J ude, the brothers of the Lord, while he keeps the term ἀνεψιός
for Symeon, the cousin of the Lord and second bishop of Jerusalem,
we shall feel that there is a strong probability against the use
of ἀδελφοί 111 1115 N.T. to denote anything but brothers, 220. 111 1115
5555 before us either half—brothers or foster-brothers, according
to the evidence to be considered later on.

(2) Jerome's main argument is that 5511155 1115 Lord's brother

s ἦε was one of the Twelve, and therefore identical with 5511155 1115 5011

of Alphaeus. He grounds this assertion 011 5 single passage in St.

⁸ Pa ul, which I shall prese ntly examine. Bishop Lightfoot and others

have shown that it is not a necessary consequence of St. Paul's
language, and that it is opposed to the distinction everywhere made
in the N.T. between the Brethren of the Lord and the Twelve.
Thus in Acts i. 14, after the list of the Eleven including James the
son of A11,›hacus‚we read ‘these all continued instant in prayer'
