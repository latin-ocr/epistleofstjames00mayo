are to regard this as a true middle, it would seem that the dis-
tinction between it and the active here is analogous to that between
τιθέναι and τίθεσθαι νόμον. God acting by his own sov ereign will ἐνεργεῖ,

Ι 111111 now to the explan ttions ofleied by previous editors. The
old Greek commentators give it a pissive sense, Oecumenius and 1
Theophylact interpreting it much as Matthaei' s scholiast συνεργουμένη “
ὑπὸ τῆς τοῦ δεομένου γνώμης καὶ πράξεως ‘assisted by (actualized by) ¹
the intention and the action of the sick man, ’and not fai otherwise
Euthymius and (Jr'amers Catena‘ strengthened and heartened by the
penitence and obedience of the sick,' which they illustrate by the
case of Samuel forbidden to pray for Saul, of Jeremiah forbidden to
pray for the Jews. They also give a second interpretation, according
to which the just man' s piayer is 01101Ας1Ζοἀ by his own life of active
godliness (τὴν δέησιν” ενεργον καὶ ζῶσαν τοῖς τρόποις τῶν ἐντολῶν ψυχουμένην

ἷ.σχυρὰν καὶ πάντα δυναμένην ο δίκαιος” εχει τὴν δεησιν’ ενεργουμένην ταῖς
ε’ντολαῖς); ef. Theodoret' s note on the next verse ταῦτα τοῦ θείου πνεύ-
ματος ἐνεργοῦντος εἴρηκεν ὁ προφήτης in the same Catena. Blichaelis
takes it in the way suggested above preces (micante Spiritu effusae. De
Wette, Hofmann, Huther, Alford take it ‘the prayer of a righteous
man avails much in its working,' but this gives a very poor force to a
word which ought from its position to be emphatic. Erdmann trans-
lates ‘viel vermag das Gebet des Gerechten indem es sich wirksam
erweist,' which appears to me either tautological or unmeaning: prayer
is no prayer at all, if it is not real. Bp. Wordsworth seems to strain
the force of the preposition <which cannot be other in the verb than in
adj. ἔνεργος, from which it is derived) when he translates ‘working
inwardly,’ ‘inwardly energizing in devotion and love, so as to pro· ,
duce external effects in obedience.' Most commentators take it with
Luther ‘ wenn es ernstlich ist’ (so Dean Scott ‘when urgent,' he ¹
compares Col. iV. 12 πάντοτε ἀγωνιζόμενος ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς) 3
though some ignore the participial force and make it simply equivalent ι’
to ἐνεργής (Heb. iv. 12, Philem. 6) or ἐκτενής (Luke xxii. 44, Acts xii. ¹
5), as Schneckenburger, Kern, Bouman, Wiesinger. I would not deny
that ἐνεργουμένη may be used in the sense of ἐνεργὴς οὖσα, but no
precise parallel is cited. Pallad. Laus. 1083 B and Eustath. on Odyss.
δ. p. 197, 50 are cited for the phrase προσευχὴ ἐνεργής. Lange tries to ι.
combine the form of the passive and middle, ‘ die mit der vollen Hinge- ⁸
bung an den g'ottlichen Impuls zugleich gesetzt volle Spannung des
betenden Geistes.’

17. ἅνθρωπος ἦν ὁμοιοπαθὴς ἡμῖν] The Classical word ὄμ. is used by
Paul of himself and Barnabas to the people of Lystra, by the Fathers
of Christ (eg. Euseb. HJJ. i. 2, cf. Heb. iv. 15), in 4 Maec. xii. 13 to 1.

the writer to inSist on the resemblance between us and Elijah because
οΥ the exaggerated ideas entertained of the latter at that time (see
Sir. xlviii. 1-12): ‘ Such potency of prayer is not out of our reach, for
Elijah possessed it. though he gave evidence of weakness similar to
