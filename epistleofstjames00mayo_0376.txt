11⁴3 THE EPISTIAE OF ST. JAMES

ἄχη βρύει Aesch. C'ltoeplt. 62, θράσει βρύων Ay. 177, λόγοι μεστοὶ
πνεύματος θείου καὶ βρύοντες δυνάμει, Justin M. Tryph. 9. The only
instance cited from a clas-sical author for the transitive use is Anacr.
(44, 1. 2 Bergk) χάριτες βρύουσι ῥόδα, where however Hermann reads
ῥόδου βρύουσιν ; Justin M. (T‘t‘yjpll. 114) has τῆς πέτρας ζῶν ὕδωρ βρυούσ-ης,
cf. (fhrysostoni (hom. ito maa-t„ Migne I’utrol. vol. 50, p. 664) οῖ τάφοι
τῶν μαρτύρων βρύουσιν εὐλογίαν, Clem. Hom. ii. 45 πηγὰς γῇ βρύα-ας
Θεός. Eustath. in Il. ρ, p. 1126, 42 ((ι]1.1ν616’ῡ.) says it is properly
used of olive blossoms and, later, of springs, as in Acta Johannis
p. 276 Τ. βρύουσαν τὴν πηγὴν εὗρον, Aeta Thomae p. 22, Clem. Hom.
iii. 36. Ὀπή ‘a cleft in a rock,’ elsewhere in N.T. only in Heb. xi.
38, also 111 LXX.‚ Exod. xxxiii. 22, obad. 3. Πικρόν only used here
and below in N.T. Its use here in preference to ἁλυκόν or ἁλμυρόν is
doubtless owing to its often being found in a figurative sense, e.g.
ver. 14, ΡΞ. lxiv. 3, Sirao. iv. 6 καταρᾶσθαι ἐν πικρίᾳ ψυχῆς. It is
descriptive of sea-water, like smum-us, our ‘brackish.' The Dead Sea
however, to which St. James is p1·ol'›al.›ly alluding, was really bitter
and had both salt and fresh springs on its shores. Other examples of
bitter waters are Marah (Exod. XV. 23), ‘ the water that causeth the
curse ’ (Numb. v. 18-27), Apoc. viii. 11. Pliny NH. ii. 103 has a fable
of a fountain of the Sun which was sweet ancl cold at noon and bittel-
and hot at midnight. Antigonus (Mirab. 148 ap. Wetsm gives an
account of such a spring τὸν δὲ Ἱμέραν ἐκ μιᾶς πηγῆς σχιζόμενον τὸ μὲν
ἁλυκὸν τῶν ῥείθρων ἔχειν, τὸ δὲ πότιμον; in 4 Esdras v. 9 one Of the
prodigies which announce Messiah's coming is in dulcibus aquis salsae
invenientur.

12. μὴ δύναται] See on ii. 14.

συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι] Cf. for the use of ποιεῖν Matt. iii. 10 πᾶν δένδρον
μὴ ποίουν καρπόν, Gen. i. 11, Vorst, p. 162 and 8305 and for the pro-
verbial figure Matt. vii. 16, ib. xii. 33, lsa. v, 2, Seneca Ep. 87 non
nascitur em malo bouum, ‘non wayis quam ficus ew olea, Epict. Dis-5⁵. ii. 20
πῶς γὰρ δύναται ἄμπελος μὴ ἀμπελικῶς κινεῖσθαι ἀλλ’ ἐλαικῶς; ἦ ε’λαιά
πιιλιν μὴ ἐλαικῶς ἀλλ’ ἀμπελικῶς; Plutv. Mor. 472 F τὴν ἄμπελον σῦκα
φέρειν οὐκ ἀξιοῦμεν οὐδὲ τὴν ἐλαίαν βότρυς, Anton. 8. 15.

οὔτε ἁλυκὸν γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ] For this irregular use of οὔτε see
NViner, p. 614, where the editor cites Tim-homdorf mihi non dubium est
qu‹e·nj'(1t1'sceme Graecitate eriam οὔτε pro οὐδέ sit dictum. So Apoc. ix.
21 οὐ μετενόησαν ἐκ τῶν φόνων αὐτῶν οὔτε ἐκ τῶν φαρμάκων αὐτῶν οὕτε ἐκ
πορνείας αὐτῶν, where οὐ is parallel with offra, not overlapping. In our
text it may perhaps be explained by the preceding question being re—
garded as = οὕτε συκῆ κ.τ.λ. Ἃλυκόν classicaL but found elsewhere in
the Bible only 111 phrase ἡ θάλασσα ἡ ἁλυκή, as a name for the Dead Sea
(Nunib. iii. 12, Dent. iii. 17). The rare phrase ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ is assimilated
to π. ἐλαίας above : we find it used of rain Arist. l'esp. 261 ὕδωρ ἀναγκαίως
ἔχει τὸν θεὸν ποιῆσαι.

Many MSS. and versions read οὕτως οὐδέ, a smaller number insert
μία πηγή and καί after ἁλυκόν. Tho insertion Of οὕτως may have
arisen from a dittographia of οὔτε, but the latter insertions were
evidently intended to avoid the difficulty of taking ἁλυκόν as a sub-
