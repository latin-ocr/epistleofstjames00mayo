III 9-11 NOTEs 115

form, and that the worst form, of καταλαλιὰ and κρίσις (below iv. 11)2
So St. Paul, Rom. xii. 14 εὐλογεῖτε καὶ μὴ καταρᾶσθε, cf. Luke Vi. 28.
Cui-sing will then be the overfiow 01 the bitter water spoken 01 111 ver.
ll, ⁶ the water which causeth the curse' (Numbers v. 18) ; a sign of the
ζῆλος πικρός which characterizes the wisdom of this world (below ver.
14). Nor is 11115 view of the wrongfulness of cursing unknown in the
Ο.Τ. : cf. Job xxxi. 29, 30 (‘ neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by
wishing a curse to his, i.e. my enemy's, soul ³) 3 it is the mark 01 the
wicked that ἀρᾶς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ γέμει καὶ πικρίας, Ρ5. Χ. 7. But then,
why is not st. J ames content to condemn cursing in itself 2 Why does
he only condemn it when combined with what is good, blessing? It is
because ‘the wrath 01 man worketh not the righteousness of God’
(above i. 20), because ‘ bitterness proves that we are lying against the
truth ² (below v. 14); in the words of St. John (1 ep. iv. 20) because
‘ he that loveth not his brother cannot love God‚’ so that the mixture
of cui-sing proves the unreality of the blessing, 01. Matt. xii. 34, ib. v.
23, 24.

ἐξέρχεται εὐλογία καὶ κατ-ὄψῳ] Where there is one predicate to several
connected subjects, of which the nearest to the verb is in the singular
number, the predicate, if it precedes the subjects, may itself be in the
singular, as though it referred only to the nearest subject : cf. 1 Tim.
vi. 4 ἐξ ὧν γίνεται φθόνος, ἔρις, βλασφημίαι, Apoc. ix. 17, ἐκ τῶν στομάτων
αὐτῶν ἐκπορεύεται πῦρ καὶ καπνὸς καὶ θεῖον, VViner, p. 651, Madv. ξ 2 6.,
Krueg. 63. 4.

οὐ χρὴ ταῦτα οὕτως γίνεσθαι.] χρή not found elsewhere in N.T., occurs
111 Prov. xxv. 27 τιμᾶν χρὴ λόγους ἐνδόξους. It is about equivalent to
ὀφειλομεν, weaker than δεῖ, which properly implies not merely what
ought to be, but what must be, though at times it comes very near to
χρή, as in Mai-k xiii. 14 ἑστὼς ὅπου ου’ δεῖ, 2 Tim. ii. 24 δοῦλον Κυρίου οὗ
δεῖ μάχεσθαι. Some hold that οὕτως 15 pleonastic with ταῦτα, merely
adding emphasis, as where it marks the apodosis (Winer, p. 678) :
should it not rather be taken as summing up what was said before of
the manner in which the blessings and curses are uttered with an
unbridled tongue under the violence of passion? I think we cannot
assume that St. James would have condemned such anathemas as we
find in 1 Cor. xvi. 22, Gal. i. 8. Dr. Plummer compares Numb. xxiii.
8 ⁶ How shall I curse whom God hath not cursedZ '

11. μήτι ἡ πηγὴ ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς ὀπῆς βρύει τὸ γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ πικρόν.] For the
interrogative μή compare ver. 12 3 the sostened form μήτι 15 common in
Nss„ cf. the parallel in Matt. vii. 16 μήτι συλλέγουσιν ἀπὸ ἀκανθῶν
σταφυλήν ,· ib. xxvi. 22, but comparatively rare in classical writers.
For figure cf. Philo M. l. p. 199 πηγὴ λόγων διάνοια καὶ στόμιον
αὐτῆς λόγος, ὅτι τὰ ἐνθυμήματα πάντα διὰ τούτου καθάπερ νάματα ἀπὸ γῆς
εἷς τούμφανὲς ἐπιρρέοντα ἀναχεῖται, ib. 447. Βρύει is not found elsewhere
in N.T. or LXX. : 111 Classical Greek it 15 used intransitively with the
dative, as in Arist. Nub. 45 (βίος) βρύων μελίτταις, Ηο111. Il. xvii. 56
ἔρνος βρύει ἄνθεϊ λευκῷ, also with gen. (Soph. O.C'. 17 χῶρος ..βρύων
δάφνης, ἐλαίας), properly in reference to plants bursting into bud and

flower‚ or of the land in spring (Xen. Cyozey. v. 12), then metaph20rically
