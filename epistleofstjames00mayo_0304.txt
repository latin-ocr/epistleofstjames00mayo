46 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ὃημα βασιλείας ἐν χειρὶ Θεοῦ σου. The question then is, froni which of
these usos is tlu¹ metaphor here derived. Uolnparing ii. 5, where what
is here said of tho crown is repeated of thc kingdom, it would seem
natural to take the word as implying sovercignty‚ and this would agree
with Wisd. v. 1⁴5 δίκαιοι λήψονται τὸ βασίλειον τῆς εὐπρεπείας καὶ τὸ διάδημα
τοῦ κάλλους ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου, ὦ. ili. 8, Dan. Vii. 27 ‘the kingdom was
given to tho saint-,s of the Most High‚’ Apoc. i. 6, 1 Pet. ii. 9 ὑμεῖς
βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα, Rom. v. 17 οἶ τὴν περισσείαν τῆς χάριτος λαμβάνοντες
ἐν ζιυῆ βασιλεύσουσιν, Luko xii. 32 ‘it is my h‘ather’s good pleasure to
give ⁸you the king‹lo1n‚’ ila. xxii. 28 ‘ I appoint unto you a kingdom,
and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel‚' 2 Tim.
ii. 12 εἰ ὑπομένομεν καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν, which reminds one of Zech. vi.
14 ὁ στέφανος ἔσται τοῖς ὑπομένουσι, following immediately after κατ-ἄρξει
ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνοι· αὐτοῦ, so the Stoic paradox sapiens rem. The nearest
parallel< to our passage are Apoc. ii. 10 γίνου πιστὸς ἄχρι θανάτου καὶ
δώσω σοι τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς, 2 Tim. iv. 8 ἀποκεῖταί μοι ὁ τῆς δικαιο-
σιῗιής στέφανος ὃ ἀποδώσει μοι ὁ Κύριος ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ...καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς
ἠγαπηκόσι τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν αὐτοῦ, 1 Pet. v. 4 φανερωθέντος τοῦ ἀρχιποιμένος
κομιεῖσθε τὸν ἀμαράντινον τῆς δόξης στέφανον. The use Of the article in
all these ¹seems to imply some well-known saying or a very definite
expectation. On the other hand, the idea of a kingly crown seems less
appropriate in them than that of a crown of merit or victory. The
8111111111»- talk of three crowns (Pil-ke Aboth iv. 19). Probably the
metaphorical use would be coloured by all the literal uses. Other
iustam-cs :ire Sir. 1. 16, vi. 30, xv. 6, Acta Matt. Tisch. p. 169 ἐγγύς
ἐστιν τῆς ὑπομονῆς σου ὁ στέφανος, Philo Lqus. All. M. p. 86 σπούδασον
στεφανωθῆναι κατὰ τῆς τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας νικώσης ἡδονῆς καλὸν καὶ εὐκλεᾶ
στέφανον ὃν οὐδεμία πανήγυρις ἀνθρώπων ἐχώρησε.

τῆς ζωῆς] Gen. of delinition, as in the parallels quoted in the last
n. : ‘ the crown which consiste in life eternal.' Of. l John ii. 25 αὕτη
ἐστὶν ἡ ἐπαγγελία ἣν αὐτὸς ἐπηγγείλατο ὑμῖν, τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον, l Pet.
iii. 7. This is contrasted with thc fading away of earthly prosperity.
Zeller und Hilgenfeld (Asamus. wiss. Tlaeol. 1873, p. 93 and p. 10) con-
sider that the expression is horrowed from Apoc. ii. 10, this being the
promise referred to below. [NVisdom promises a crown and life, Prov.
iv. 2», iii. 18, Aboth vi. CIL]

ὃν ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν.] Κύριος Ol* Θεός is inserted in some
MSS. but in AB sin. (rc. the subject is omitted, as in Heb. iv. 3 καθὼς
εἴρηκεν, and often in introducing a quotation: cf. iv. 6, Eph. iV. 8,
Gal. iii. 16, 1 Cor. vi. 16, Heb. X. 5, and &Viner p. 735. Putting on one
side Apoc. ii. 10, which was probably written subsequently to this
cpistlc, wc do not find the precise words τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς in
any particular passage of the Bible. It is a question therefore
whether they constitute an unwritten word, a record of oral teaching‚
311011115- we have in Acts xx. 35, and of which others have been pre-
served by early Christian writers 3 ¹ or whether it is an instance of

which lu: vouqmrvs 1⁸21. xxii. 17-21 and Acta Philippi, p. 147 Τ.) hc includes i. 17
