CHAPTER IX

ΟΝ THE STYLE or ST. JAMES

The last chapter contained a survey of the grammatica] usages
of our Epistle. In the present chapter I propose to consider what
conclusions may be drawn from that survey, as well as from an
examination of the vocabulary of the Epistle‚ from its use of
rhetorical figures, rhythm and arrangement of words, in reference
to the Author's command over the resources of the Greek language
and the (listinctive qualities of his style.

To deal first with any peculial-ities of Iwfleaeion, he adheres to
classical usage with the majority of the writers of tho N.T. as

regards the gender of πλοῦτος and ζῆλος, which are sometimes Γ

made neuter by St. Paul.

As regards the Future, the reading κερδήσομεν, is not quite
certain in iv. 13. It is not found elsewhere in the Bible, but the
only trace of the Attic κερδανῶ is the doubtful reading inii-3912
ix, 21, while the aor. ἐκέρδησα is common. σαίῃ,,φάτ)ιομαι in

ΤΞ is the only future of ἐσθίω employed in the N.T. In the
LXX. ἔδομαι and φάγομαι are both common, and are sometimes
used in the same passage without any difference of meaning,
eg. Numb. xviii. 10 φάνγομαι, ver. 11 ἔδομαι, Deut. xii. 20 and 24
φάνγομαι, ver. 22 ἔδεται, so too καταφάὙομαι and κατέδομαι.

As to the Perfect, we find parallels to εἰσελήλυθαν in John,
Luke, Paul, and Laconian inscriptions. As there is no instance of
the 3rd pl. either of the imperfect or 2nd aor. in our Epistle,
there is no evidence to show whether James would have used such
barbarous forms as εἴχοσαν with John, or παρελάβοσαυ with Paul,
see Hort Appendice, p. 165.

As to the Imperative‚ ἤτω occurs twice in the LXX. and only
inone other place of the N.T. (1 Gor. xvi. 22). It is also found in
inscriptions from Asia Minor. κάθου occurs elsewhere in the N.T.
only in quotations from the LXX. 2 it is said to have been used by
