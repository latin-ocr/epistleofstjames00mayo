τέτακται, of the initiated Plato Phaedr. 250. Ὁλοκληρία 15 used of the
lame man who was healed, Acts lii. 16. Hence, 1116ῑηξ110116η111γ Philo
Μ. 1. 190 τὰ δ’ ἄλλα, ὅσα ψυχην ὁλόκληρον κατὰ παι τα τὰ μελη παρέχεται,
ὃλοκαυτοῦν Θεῷ, ib. M. 2. p. 265 δεῖ τὸν μέλλοντα θιειν σκεπτε( σθαι, μη ει
τὸ ἱερεῖον ἄμωμον, ἀλλ εἰ ἡ διάνοια ὁλόκληρος αἰτῷ καὶ παντελὴς καθεστηκε,
Herm. lisand. v. 2. 3 πίστις ὁλόκληρος, Polyb. 18. 28. 9 εὔκλεια υλόκληρος,

It is often joined with τέλειος, as in Plut. Mor. p. 1066 F. τέλειον ἐκ
τούτων καὶ ὁλόκληρον ᾤοντο συμπληροῦν βίον, and in Philo, See on both
words Heisen pp. 299—371. In this passage it would be contrasted
with a partial keeping of the law such as we read of in ii. 9, lO.

ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι.] Τ116 preceding positive expression (ὁλόκληρος) 15
supported by the corresponding negative, as in ver. 6 ἐν πίστει μηδὲν
διακρινόμενος. The only passages in the NT. where the passive is used
(as in Plato Leyy. 9. 881 Β δεῖ τὰς ἐνθάδε κολάσεις μηδὲν τῶν ἐν Αἶδοῦ λεί-
πεσθαι) are this and 1116 following verse and ii 15. strictly it means

‘being left behind by another. ' It 15 used with the gen. both of per son
and thing, rar ely of both together. Moie usually the thing 1s expr essed
by the dau 01¹ acc„ or with a preposition, εἵς τι, κατά τι, πρός τι, ἔν τιιι.
The active occurs ivith much the same sense in class ical Greek, Arist.
Gen. An. iv. 1. 36 οἱ εὐνοῦχοι μικρὸν λείπουσι τοῦ θήλεος την ἰδέαν (⁶ fall
short of ')‚ and is also used of the thing with dat. of the person, Luke
xviii. 22 ἕν σοι λείπει (ζ 15 lacking’). We may compare l Cor. 7 μὴ
ὑστερεῖσθαι ἐν μηδενὶ χαρίσματι. Μηδενί 15 required as it is a negative
in a final clause, cf. Phil. iii. 9 ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω...μὴ ἔχων ἐμὴν
δικαιοσύνην, and WViner, p. 598.

There is a close resemblance between the scale here given of Chris-
tian growth and that 111 Rom. v. 4. After speaking of& the Christian
exulting (καυχώμεθα ver. 9 below) in the hope of the glor) of God,
nay even ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν, St Paul continues εἰδότες ὅτι ἡ θλίψις (= τὸ
δοκίμιον τῆς πιστεως 01 πειρασμος 11θιθ>ὑπομονην κατεργάζεται. These two
stages may be considered the same as those given here : but the thu d
seems inconsistent. Here endurance leads to the pei-fection of the
Christian character· there the words ἡ δὲ ὑπομονη ὃοκιμην apparently
reverse the filst step of St. James. The woid δοκιμη 1101176161 is not
there used m the same sense as oui¹ δοκίμιον, of which it is rathel the
result and this, the tried ¹ind tested character 15 not very different
from St. J ames ‘penssfectiom² of which we may consider the two
following stages in St. Paul (ἡ δὲ δοκιμὴ ἐλπιὸα, ἡ δὲ ἐλπὶς οὗ καταισ-
χύνει, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκέχυται) to be marks orelements.The1-'c 15
a similar chain, including ὑπομονή, 111 2 Pet. i. 5 foll„ where however
there seems no attempt to give a natural 01· chi onological 01¹ der.

5. εἰ δέ τις λείπεται σοφίας. ] The preceding λειπόμενοι is caught up like
τέλειος and ὑπομονή before. The thought omitted 1s thus supplied by
Bede ε si quis vestrum uon potest intelleqere utilitatem tentationum quae
fidelibus probandi causa eveniunt, postulet a Deo tribui sibi sensum quo
diquoscere valeat quauta pietate Pater castiyat. filios (‘ how am I to 566
tr'ial 1n this light, and make this use of it? it needs a higher wisdom '.)

The ideas of wisdom and pei-fection are often joined, as in 1 (ΞΟΓ. 11. ι
