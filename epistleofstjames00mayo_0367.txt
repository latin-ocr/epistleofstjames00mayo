inan to man. Here it is described as ἡ σπιλοῦσα τὸ σῶμα, but in i. 27
this is said to be the effect of the worldg true religion is shown by
keeping oneself ἄσπιλον ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου. 0131111113011, &tien and Lange
give this meaning to the passage, and l think it is hinted at by the
Greek commentators. Dr. Taylor has pointed out (J. of l’lm'l. xviii.
p. 320) that, in place of the phrase ἡ γλῶσσα, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας,
Hermas 11303 ἡ πονηρὰ ἐπιθυμία ln ‘'llancl. xii. 1 μισήσεις τὴν πονηρὰν
ἐπιθυμίαν καὶ χαλιναγωγήσεις αὐτηι καθὼς βούλει (οΥ. *11)*010 ver. 4, ὅπου

δυσκόλως ἡμεροῦται (cf. below ver. 8,(1ἰδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται). Again
17311. 2,he uses the phi ase οὐκ ἀπέχεται τῆς γλ(’1σσης’ ει ᾗ πονηρευεται.

Dr. Taylor further illustrates the text, if understood in the sense
universitas iniquitatis, from T. B. Bel-achoth 151), ‘ Life and death are
in the hand of 1110 tongue. Has the tongue a hand ¹2 No, but as the
hand kills‚ so the tongue. The hand kills only at close quarters: the
tongue is called an arrow as killing at a distance. An arrow kills at
for-ty or fifty paces: but of the tongue it is said (Psa. lxxiii. 9)
“they have set their mouth in heaven and their tongue goeth
through the earth.'' It ranges over the whole earth and reaches to
heaven.'

It may be worth while to mention that the Peshitto‚ followed by
Morus, Bassett and others, takes κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας independently of ἡ
γλώσσα, and supplies ὕλη as subject: ‘the tongue is the fire, the world
of wickedness the forest’ (which it consumes). It is possible that
there was an old gloss ὕλη intended to explain a diffieulty5 but it
is inconsistent with the general thought : the tongue sets on fire the
τροχὸς γενέσεως not the κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας, and it has been already
shown that to put the stop after ἀδικίας gives an impossible construction
for the following clause.

The word καθίσταται literally means ‘is set‚' ‘is constituted.'¹ It
is opposed to ὑπάρχω, because it implies a sort of adaptation or
development as eontrasted with the natural 01· original state 3 to
γίνομαι, because it implies something of fixity. So in iv. 4 ὃς ἐὰν
βουληθῇ φίλος εἶναι τοῦ κόσμου, ἐχθρὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ καθίσταται, ‘ Whoever will
be a friend of the world thereby becomes (is constituted) an enemy of
God! of. Thuc. iv. 92 πρὸς τοὺς ἀστυγείτονας πᾶσι τὸ ἀντίπαλον καὶ
ἐλεύθερον καθίσταται ‘equality const-itutes freedom,' Isocr. p. 37 οἱ
μεγίστας ἐπ’ ἀρετῇ δόχας ἔχοντες πλείστων δεσπόται καθίστανται. For ἐν
τοῖς μέλεσιν cf. iv. 1 below.

ἡ σπιλοῦσα ὅλον τὸ σῶμα.] Of course an attribute of ἡ γλῶσσα. See
above i. 27, J ude 23 μισοῦντες τὸν ἀπὸ τῆς σαρκὸς ἐσπιλωμένον χιτῶνα,

¹ That it is passive and not middle may be inferi-ed from the fact that out of the
twenty—two instances in Brucler, while sixteen belong to the active voice and two are
lst aor. pass„ there are only four examples of the ambiguous form καθίσταται, two
of 11111011 are those cited above troni this 01113110, and the other two (ch. v. 1 πῖις
