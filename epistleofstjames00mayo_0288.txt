30 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

kingdom3 and in Matt. xix. 28 it is said that the twelve apostles
shall hei-caster ‘sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of
Israel’ z comp. also Rev. vii. 4 foll. The prophets looked forward to
the reunion of lsrael and Judah (isa. xi. 12, 13, Jerem. iii. 18), and
under llczekiah and ‚losiah many of the remnant of the Ten Tribes
caune up to worship at Jerusalem (2 Chr. xxix. 24, xxx. 1, xxxiv. 9).
So twelve goats were offered as a sin-offering for the twelve tribes at
the dedication of the second Temple (Ezra vi. 17). There would be no
reason for keeping up the old feud between the tribes in the captivity 3
and while it is probable that some of those who were carried away by
Shalmanezer may have adopted the manners and religion of the neigh-
bouring heathen, many would no doubt attach themselves to the later
captives from Judah, and either return with the minority of these to
Judaea, or continue to live in Assyria with the majority. The book
Tobit professes to give the story of a religious captive of the tribe of
Naphtali3 and Anna (Luke ii. 36) is an instance of a resident in
J udah belonging to the tribe of Asher. See D. of B. under Captivities.
This form of addi-ess is one among many indications of an early date
for the epistle‚ the Christian Jews not being yet definitely marked
off from their unbclieving countrymen. [Hermas (Sim. ix. 17) however
includes all the nations under heaven in his Twelve Tribes. O.T.]

epistle is addressed, and ef. 1 Pet. i. 1 ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς

probable, is here addressing the Jews of the eastern dispersion‚ this
may have suggested to St. Peter his letter to the western dispersion)‚

χέρεια] χαῖρε is the regular form of Greek salutation‚ as in Luke i.
28, 2 John 103 like salve in Latin. In letters it takes the form
χαίρειν (λέγει), like salutem (dicit). Horace (Ep. i. 8. 1 and 15) uses the
more literal translation {laudere et bene ‘rem θεν-ενα (χαίρειν καὶ εὖ πράτ-
τειν). It is said to have been first used by Cleon in sending news of the
capture of Pylos (Luc. Laps. inter Salut. 3, Suidas ευ). Aristophanes
in his latest play speaks of it as already old-fashioned‚ l’lut. 322
χαίρειν μὲν ὑμᾶς ἐστιν, ἄνδρες δημόται, ἀρχαῖον ἤδη προσαγορεύειν καὶ σαπρόν·
ἀσπάζομαι δ’. Plato is said to have preferred the phrase εὖ πράττειν in
writing to his intimates (Pl. Ep. 3, p. 315). The Pythagoreans used
ὑγιαίνειν (see Menage on Diog. L. iii. 61). In the Ν .Τ. the epistolary
χαίρειν is only found here and in Acts xxiii. 26 (the letter of Lysias
to Felix) and xv, 23 (the letter, probably drawn up by St. James‚
from the Church at Jerusalem to the brethren in Antioch, Syria and
Cilicia). In 2 Maec. ix. 19 we find the above forms of salutation com-
bined, τοῖς χρηστοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς πολίταις πολλὰ χαίρειν καὶ ὑγιαίνειν καὶ
εὖ πράττειν βασιλεὺς καὶ στρατηγὸς Ἀντίοχος. 'Phe ancient Hebrew salu-
