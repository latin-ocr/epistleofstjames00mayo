172 ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ii. ξ 4) referred to in the same note, in which the different remissiones
peccatorum in the Gospel are enumerated ε (l) baptism, (2) martyrdom‚
(3) almsgiving (which he supports by Luke xi. 41), (4) forgiveness of
others (supported by Matt. vi. 14), (5) converting a sinner, ita enim
dicit scriptura divina, quia qui converti fecerit peccatorem ab errore viae
succe salvat animcwnl a morse et cooperit multitudinem peccatorum‚2 (6)
love (supported by Luke vii. 47 and l Pet. iv. 8) 3 and much in the same
way Cassian (Colc. xx. 8) enumerating the various ways in which sin
may be blotted out, besides simple penitence, mentions the conversion
of others by our exhortations. Other passages in which almsgiving is
referred to as efficacious for the saving of the soul are Didache iv. 6
ἐὰν ἔχῃς διὰ τῶν χειρῶν σου δώσεις3 λύτρωσιν ἁμαρτιῶν σου, Constit.
Apost. vii. 12 δός, ἵνα ἐργάσῃ εἷς λύτρωσιν ἁμαρτιῶν σου· ἐλεημοσύναις
γὰρ καὶ πίστεσιν ἀποκαθαίρονται ἁμαρτίαι, so Earn. xix. 10. Luko xvi. 9
is naturally understood in the same sense.

It appears to me that these passages leave little doubt as to the
ordinary way of thinking among Jewish writers on this subject,
both before and after the Christian era 3 and if we further consider
the use of the future tense (σώσει, καλύψει) touched on in the
previous note, and the fact that, if the saving of the soul and
the hiding of sins have reference to the sinner, they do not essen-
tially differ from what is already involved in the protasis, which
states the conversion of the sinner from the >error of his way,
it might seem that we ought to interpret the verse as Origen
does in the passage just quoted. So Euth. Zig. and Cramer's
C'atemb (in loc.) τοιοῦτον τὸ ἐν τῷ Ἰερεμίᾳ εἰρημένον, (καὶ ἐὰν ἐξαγάγῃς
τίμιον ἀπὸ ἀναξίου ὡς στόμα μου ἕσται·’ ἐάν φησιν, εἷς τῶν ἀπολλυμένων
διὰ τὴν κακίαν εὐτελῶν σωθῇ διὰ τῶν σῶν λόγων, ἔντιμος ἔσῃ διὰ τοῦτο
παρ’ ἐμοί. We may also compare Dan. xii. 3 ‘they that be wise
shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that
turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever,' l Tim.
iv. 16 ἔπεχε σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ· τοῦτο γὰρ ποιῶν καὶ σεαυτὸν
σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου, 1 Cor. iii. 14, 15, Pil‘k& Aboth v.
26, 27 ‘whosoever makes the many righteOUS, sin prevails not
over him, and whosoever makes the many to sin, they grant him
not the faculty to repent‚' Clem. Al. Str. vii. p. 52 ὁ γνωστικὸς, ἰδίαν
σωτηρίαν ἡγούμενος τὴν τῶν πέλας ὠφέλειαν, ἄγαλμα ἔμψυχον εἰκότως ἂν
τοῦ Κυρίου λέγοιτο, Const. Ap. ii. 18 τοὺς ὑπνώδεις καὶ παρειμένους
ἐπίστρεφε, ὖποστήριζε, παρακάλει, θεράπευε, ἐπιστάμενος ἡλίκον μισθὸν ἔχεις
ταῦτα ἐπιτελῶν, ὥσπερ οὖν καὶ κίνδυνον ἐὰν ἀμελήσῃς τούτων. For a discus-
sion as to how far this is in accordance with the general teaching of
the N.T., see comment below. St. Paul's words in 1 Cor. ix. 16 may
perhaps be compared, ‘woe is me if I preach not the Gospel,’ and the
punishment of ‘the wicked and slothful servant,’ Matt. xxv. 26. It
