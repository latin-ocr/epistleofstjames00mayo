cxii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

proseucha ; and Strabo (ap. J OS. Ant. xiV. 7. 2) says that ‘it is hard
to find a spot in the whole world which is not occupied and do-
minated by Jews‚' the privileges they had enjoyed under their
Greek rulers being confirmed and extended by the Roman
>emperors from the same motives of policy. So Josephus says
(c. Ap. ii. 39) ‘there is no city, no tribe, whether Greek or bar-
barian, in which Jewish law and Jewish custom have not taken
1¹00t.’

It was expected of the members of the Diaspora that they
should not only send to the temple their yearly didrachmon, but
that they should at least once in their life go up to offer their
sacrifice there in person. Among those who listened to Peter's
vaddress on the day of Pentecost there were inhabitants of Parthia,
Media, Elam, Mesopotomia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia,
Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya about Cyrene, Rome, Crete,
Arabia. Those who disputed with Stephen are said to have
belonged to the synagogue of the freedmen of Rome, of Cyrene and
Alexandria, and of Cilicia and Asia (Acts vi. 9). Philo enumerates
the following provinces as inhabited by Jews: Egypt, Phoenicia,
Syria, Pamphylia, Cilicia, the greater part of Asia as far as Bithy-
nia and Pontus, Thessalia, Boeotia, Macedonia, Aetolia, Attica,
Argos, Corinth, the fairest districts of the Peloponnese, Euboea,
Cyprus, Crete, not to mention the settlements beyond the
Euphrates (Les). (αἱ Caium M. 2 p. 587). The proselytes who at-
tached themselves to the worship of the synagogues, the εὐσεβεῖς
and σεβόμενοι of the Acts, as they shared in the persecutions of
the Jews (Tac. Ana. ii. 85, Suet. Dono. 12), would doubtless be
generally reckoned as belonging to the Diaspora. It was as
occasional visitors to Jerusalem that the Jews and Proselytes of
the Dispersion would come under the cognizance of the President
of the Christian community at Jerusalem. The instructions and
warnings contained in his Epistle would naturally be founded on
his observation of their special needs and dangers, as wellas on
his intimate acquaintance with the national character and the
general conditions of the time. On this something will be said
presently.

It may be asked however whether we are to understand St.
James as using the word Diaspora here in its widest sense, or
whether he had any special portion of the Diaspora in his eye
