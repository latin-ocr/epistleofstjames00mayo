150 THE EPISTLF. oF ST. .JAM}‹:s

Arist. Top. ii. 2, p. 109b ἕως τῶν ἀτόμων,1 then by Polyb. i. 18. 2 οὐκ
ἀντεξῄεσαν πλὴν ἕως ἀκροβολισμοῦ, ofben in LXX. and N.T. The word
παρουσία ‘visible presence' is regularly used for the Second Coming,
as below v, 8, Matr„ xxiv. 3, xxxvii. 39. 1 Thess. ii. 19, iv. 15, dvo,
2 Pet.. iii. 4. other expressions are ἀποκάλυψις Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ 1 Pet.
i. 7, 13, ἐπιφάνεια Tit). ii. 13, 2 Tim. iv. 1 3 ἡ ἐπιφάνεια τῆς παρουσίας,
2 Thess. ii. 9.

ἰδού] As in iii. 4, 5, directs attention to the following illustration.

ὁ γεωργός] For the comparison see Sir. vi. 18 ὡς ὁ ἀροτριῶν καὶ ὁ
σπείρων προσέλθε τῇ παιδείᾳ καὶ ἀνάμενε τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς καρποὺς αὐτῆς, Psa.
cxxvi. 5, 6, Mate. xiii. 30, ib. xxiv. 32, John iv. 35 foll„ 1 Cor. iii. 5-9,
Gal. vi. 7, 2 Tim. ii. 6, Menander p. 245 Mein. ὁ τῶν γεωργῶν ἡδονὴν ἔχει
βίος, ταῖς ἐλπίσιν τάλγεινὰ παραμυθούμενος, Tibull. ii. 6. 21 spes alit
ayvieoloes, &a

ἐκδέχεται] Cf. what seems like a reminiscence in Clem. Rom. ii. 20,
γυμναζόμεθα τῷ νῦν βίῳ ἵνα τῷ μέλλοντι στεφανωθῶμεν· οὐδεὶς τῶν δικαίων
ταχὺν καρπὸν ἔλαβεν ἀλλ’ ἐκδέχεται αὐτόν. He goes on to give the
reason for this, εἶ γὰρ τὸν μισθὸν τῶν δικαίων ὁ Θεὸς συντόμως ἀπεδίδου,
εὐθέως ἐμπορίαν ἠσκοῦμεν καὶ οὗ θεοσέβειαν. The word ἐκδ. iS also found
Hob. x. 13. xi. 10, l Cor. xvi. 11 ὣς.

τίμιον] Coupled with αἷμα 1 Pet. i. 19, with ἐπάγγελμα 2 Pet. i. 4.
The prociousness of the fruit] justifies waiting.

μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ] Same phrase in Luke xviii. 7, Sir. xviii. 10,
xxix. S ἐπὶ ταπείινῳ μακροθύμησον. See Winer p. 491 on the use of ἐπί
with verbs denoting emotion.

ἕως λάβῃ] The subject is καρπός (cf. above iii. 18) contained in the
nearest object αὐτῷ, not (as Luther) the husbandman, nor (as Erdmann)
the earth. On the omission of ἄν see on ii. 10, and cf. Winer 370, 387,
Goodwin ξ 620.

πρόϊμον.] WH. read πρόϊμον here with B1, though retaining the ω in
πρωινός Apoc.. ii. 28, xxii. 16: see their Appendix, p. 152. Xenophon
usos ib of crops Oecon. xvii. 4 πολλοὶ διαφέρονται περὶ τοῦ σπόρου, πότερον
ὁ πρώῖμος κράτιστος ἦ ὁ μέσος ἢὸ ὀψιμώτατος, and so Hofmann here
understands it, as πρώϊμα is used of early figs (J er. xxiv. 2) and ὄψιμα
of wheat and rye (Exod. ix. 32). But the reference is more commonly
to rain, as in Dent. xi. 14 δώσει τὸν ὗετὸν τῇ γῇ σου καθ’ ὥραν πρώϊμον
καὶ ὄψιμον, καὶ εἷσοίσεις τὸν σῖτόν σου, Hos, vi. 4 ἥξει ὁ Κύριος ὡς ὑετὸς
ἡμῖν πρώίμος καὶ ὄψιμος (perhaps referred to here), J er. v. 24, Joel ii.
23, Zech. x. 1. The former rain comos after the sowing, the latter
just before thc ripening, seo J). os B. under ‘rain.' For the ellipsis
of ὑετός sce Winer p. 7:38 foll. and above iii. 11 τὸ γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ
πικρόν.

8. στηρίξατε τὰς καρδίας] This is more usually ascribed to the Divine
working, as in 1 Thess. iii. 13 εἷς τὸ στηρίξαι ὑμῶν τὰς καρδίας, 1 Pet. V.
10, 2 Thess. ii. 17, l‘s. li. 12, cf. Ps. xxvi. 14. It is the true cure for
διψυχία. The noun στηριγμός occurs in the same sense 2 Pet. iii. 17.

¹ The instance quoted froin Demosthenes p. 262 is contained in one os the
‹locuinents os the De Corona.
