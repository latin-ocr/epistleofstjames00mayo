82 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

xxvi. 11 κατὰ πάσας τὰς συναγωγὰς πολλάκις τιμωρῶν αὐτοῦς ἠνάγκαζον
βλασφημεῖν, :ind l Tim. i. 13 τὸ πρότερον ὄντα με βλάσφημον καὶ διώκ>
τήν καὶ ὑβριστήν. Cf. Justin M. Trypho ξ 117 (Χριστοῦ) ὄνομα βεβη-
λωθῆναι κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν καὶ βλασφημεῖσθαι οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς τοῦ λαοῦ ὑμῶν
καὶ διδάσκαλοι εἰργάσαντο, ib. ξ 16 with Otto's note. We firsb read Of
the 3111 of blasplwmy und ies punishment in Lev. xxiv. 10-16.

lf this is understood of wealthy member-s of the Ghureh, we
1111131 explain it, either by supposing that t-he rich were more readily
induced 10 apostzrtize and blaspheme Christ (of. Acts xxvi. 11, Plin.
lz'p. x. 97. 5, Polyo. Mart. 9) than the poor, which may be illusssrated
from Herm. Sim. viii. (i, 4 οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ ἀποστάται καὶ προδόται τῆς ε’κκλη-
σίας καί βλασφημήσαντες ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν τὸν Κύριον (called βλάσ-
φημοι εἷς τὸν Κύριον ib. ix. 19, 1) ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἐπαισχυνθέντες τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου
τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, where see Hal-nack's note 3 or, in aec-ordanoe with
10111, ii. ’.11 τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν (a
quotation from 1311. 111. 5), 2 Peb. ii. 2 δι’ οὓς ἡ ὁδὸς τῆς ἀληθείας βλασ-
φημηθήσεται, l Tim. Vi. 1 ἵνα μὴ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ βλασφημῆται, Tib.
ii. 5, we may understand it of those who profess 110 know God but by
their works deny Him, Tib. i. 16, cf. Olem. Rom. ii. 13. The 1130 of the
active voice seems 1033 suited to this interpretation, though Theile cites
from Euseb. ILE. V. 1 διὰ τῆς ἀναστροφῆς αὐτῶν βλασφημοῦντες τὴν ὁδόν.
011 1110 whole I think the general sense of the passage suits better with
the idon. that the blasphemer-s are unbelieving Jews, as in Acts xiii. 45
ἀντέλεγον βλασφημοῦντες, and this is suggested, as Dr. Plummer
remark& by the following ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, 11οῢ ἐπ1 αὐτούς.

τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς] Τ1113 Hebraism 0011103 from the LXX. (Amos ix.
12) πάι τα τὰ ἔθνη ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς, also quoted
by 1110 writer of 11113 epistle in his address to the Council ab Jerusalem
<Acts xv. 17). The phrase 13 common in the QT„ see Deut. xxviii.

15. Jt. 13 used not. only of Israel, as the people of Jehovah, but also of
the wil'e taking the husbaml's name (Isa. iv. 1), of children named after
their father (Gon. xlviii. 16). It is questioned whether the reference
11010 is to the name Χριστιανός, which came into use ab Antioch appa-
rently 1101010 Sta. Paul's first missionary journey (Acts xi. 26), and
which 13 found Acts xxvi. 28, 1 Pet. iv. 16 (see Lightfoot's squatina
vol. i. pp. 400-404); or 10 baptism, cf. Acts ii. 38 βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος
