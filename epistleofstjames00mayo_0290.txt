32 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

training sor glory, therefore χαίρετε, so lTheSS. iii. 3 οἴδατε ὅτι εἰς τοῦτο
κείμεθα, Acts v. 41. ι

ἡγήσασθε] We might have expected the present tense, hke ἡγεῖσθε
in 1 Pet. iii. 15 and below λαλεῖτε ii. 12, as the aorist is used rather of
ιι single act than of a continuous state3 but it is here employed in
reference to each separate teinptation as it occurs, perhaps also as more
urgent, like μακροθυμήσατε 111 v. 7. [The aorist is used as the authori-
tative imperative in 2 Tim. i. 8, 14, ii. 3, 15, διο. Α.] : cf. WViner tr. p.
:393 foll.

ἀδελφοί μου.] 111 1116 Ο.Τ. 1116 word is used of Israelites generally
(Lev. xxv. 46, Deut. xv. 3), denoting, as Philo says (Carit. M. 2 p.
388), οὐ μόνον τὸν ἐκ τῶν αὐτῶν φύντα γονέων ἀλλὰ καὶ ὃς ἂν ἀστὸς ἢ
ὁμόφυλος ᾗ; so also in N.T. (Acts ii. 29, Rom. ix. 3); but here it is
more commonly used of the spiritual Israel (Matt. xxiii. 8, xxv. 40,
Acts ix. 30, 1 Cor. v. 11), equivalent to the later ‘Ohristians' (see
below v. 9 and ii. 15). St, J ames frequently makes use of this appeal-
ing address (11. 1, 14, iii. 1, 10, 12, v, 12, 19), sometimes without μου
(iv. 11, v. 7, 9, 10), sometimes with the addition of ἀγαπητοί (1. 16, 19,
ii. 5). The simple ἀδελφοί is 1116 most frequent in St. Paul's epistles.
111 1116 two epistles of St. Peter and the other catholic epistles ἀγαπητοί
is often used by itself.

πειρασμοῖς] Here used of outward trial, as in the parallel passage in
1 Pet. i. 6 ἐν ᾧ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε, ὀλίγον ἄρτι εἰ δέον λυπηθέντες ἐν ποικίλοις πειρασ-
μοῖς, ἵνα τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως...εὖρεθῇ εἰς ἔπαινον κ.τ.λ. The inner
trial (teinptation) is expressed below (v. 13) by the verb πειράζω. Dr.
11111611 (Essays in Bizala-al Greek, p. 71 1011.) seems to me to restrict the
sense too much to one kind 01 trial, viz. affiiction. Riehes, as we see
from ver. 10 and 1 Tim. vi. 9, are as much a πειρασμός as poverty 3 and
1116 temptation of Christ 111 1116 wilderness (Luke iv. 13) was not an
appeal to sear but rather to hope and desire. See Oomment on
Temptation.

περιπέσητε] The word brings out the externality 01 1116 temptation
111 opposition to the internal temptation arising from ἰδία ἐπιθυμία (v. 14).
Of. Luke x. 30 λῃσταῖς περίεπεσεν, Plato Leqq. ix. 877 O. π. συμφοραῖς,
M. Ant. ii. 11 τοῖς μὲν κατ’ ἀλήθειαν κακοῖς ἵνα μὴ περιπίπτῃ ὁ ἅνθρωπος,
ἐπ’ αὐτῷ τὸ πᾶν ἔθεντο. Heisen gives many examples.

ποικίλοις] Also used 01 diseases and lusts (2 Tim. iii. 6, Matt. iv.
2-1), 10 which answcrs ποικίλη χάρις Θεοῦ (1 Pet. iv. 10). It is a common
ὲκὲηέἱῆυ Philo. For examples 01 various trials see 2 Cor. vi. 4, 5, xi.
,ι (1 .

3. γινώσκοντες] 111 111. 1, as in Rom. v. 3, we have the more usual
εἰδότες, but γιν. is found 110111. vi. 6, Hob. X. 34, 2 Ρ61. i. 20, ib. iii. 3.
Bis-top Lightfoot thus· (listinguislies them (Gal. iv, 9) : “whilst οἶδα, ‘I
know‚' refers to the knowledge 01 facts absolutely, γινώσκω, ‘I recog-
nize‚' being relative, gives prominence either 10 1116 attainment or the
manifestation of knowledgc.'' It may be questioned however whether
fine distinctions of this sort were always observed in the Hellenistic
use.
