THE AUTHOR xxi

in Matt.. i. 24 the limit is not one beyond which the action becomes
naturally and palpably impossible: on the contrary it is just that
point of time when under ordinary circumstances the action would
become both possible and natural,l when therefore the reader,
without warning to the contrary, might naturally be expected to
assume that it did actually occur. How far this assumption 011 the
part of the reader, natural under ordinary circumstances, becomes
unnatural under the very extraordinary circumstances of the case,
will be discussed further on. I confine mysclf here to the argu-
ment from language.2

(3) The natural inference drawn from the use of the word
πρωτότοκον in Luke ii. 7 is that other brothers or sisters
were born subsequently3 otherwise why should not the word μονο-
‘yemis have been used as in Tobit iii. 15 μονογενής εἰμι τῷ πατρί
μου, Luke vii. 12, viii. 42, &o [2 In Rom. viii. 29 the word is used
metaphorically, but retains its natural connotation, πρωτότοκον ἐν
πολλοῖς ἀδελφοῖς, and so in every instance of its occurrence in the
N.T. It occurs many times in its literal use in the LXX„ eg.
Gen. xxvii. 19, 32, xliii. 33, Deut. xxi. 15, 1 Kings xvi. 34, 1 Ohron.
v. 1, xxvi. 10, but, so far as I have observed, never of an only son.
It is said in answer to this by Bp. Lightfoot (p. 271) that “ the pro-
minent idea conveyed by the term first-born to a J ew would be not
the birth of other children, but the special consecration of this one.
The typica] reference in fact is foremost in the mind of St. Luke,
as he himself explains it, ‘ Every male that openeth the womb shall
be called holy to the Lord ¹ (ii. 23).” But need we ascribe to St.
Luke any other purpose, in giving this quotation from the Mosaic

was enabled to see Him, who was not only ‘the glory of his people

law as to the first-born is equally valid whether there are other
children or not 3 but St. Luke is not here concerned in stating the

a habit (‘ resrained from conjugal intercourse ') as opposed to the far more usual ἔγνω
denoting a single act.
