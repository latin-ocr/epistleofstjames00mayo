τῷ κόσμω...τὰς συναγωγὰς, λεγομένας δὲ ἐκκλησίας ἁγίας, 016111. ΑΙ.
Sl‘l· om. Vi. 4, p. 756 ἀληθεια οὐρανόθεν ἄνωθεν επὶ τὴν συναγωγὴν τῆς
ἐκκλησίας ἀφιγμενη,001161.ΑΡο6101.111.6, οὐ γαρ ἐπὶ το κοινοι τῆς
συναγωγῆς ἀνάπαυμα ἐν τῇ κυριακῇ καταιτῶσιι. Some have supposed that
συναγωγη should 116 taken 111 its ordinaly sense of a Jewish synagogue,
the epistle having been written at a time when the separation of
Christians from Jews 11116 not completely effected. Compare Westcott
[leb. p. xxxviii. ‘ Fora time the fellowship of the cliui ch and synagogue
was allowed on both sides. Ι ittle by little 1116 growth of the (Jentile
clement 111 the church excited the active hostility of the Jews against
the whole body of Christians, as it troubled the Jewish converts them—
selves. This hostility could not fail to be intensified in Palestine by
the spread of aggressive nationalism there shortly before the outbreak
of the Jewish war. . . . XVhen as yet the national unbelief of the Jews
was undeclared it was not possible to foresee that the coming of Christ
would bring the overthrow of the old order. The approaching catas-
trophe was not realized 111 the earlier apostolic writings. In the
cpistle to the Hebrews it is shown to he iinminent.’ So we read 111
Acts vi. 19 of Christians belonging to the synagogue of the Libertines3
in Acts xxm-21 it seems 10 116 implied that the Jewish Christians
still heard Moses read 111 the synagogue every sabbath-day3 ih. ix. 4
Saul takes letters to the synagogues in Damascus bidding them
to purge themselves of Christian 1066111616, cf. ΧΧ11. 19 ἐγὼ ἤμην
φυλακίζων καὶ δέρων κατὰ τὰς συναγωγὰς τοὺς πιστεύοντας ἐπὶ σέ. After-
wards in his missionary joui-heys St. Paul regularly begins by preaching
in the synagogues (Acts xiii. 14, 43 ; xiv. 1 3 xvii. 1, 2, 10, 173 xviii. 4,
26 3 xix. 8) 3 in Corinth we hear of his leaving the synagogue in con-
sequence of the violent opposition of the Jews and making use of
1111 adjoining house (Acts xviii. 7); at Ephesus he preached in the
synagogue for three months before he withdrew to the school of
Tyr ·1nnus (1ᾝό Χ1Χ. sl) In 0111· text it 16 pl ain that the wr‘itei supposes
1116 meeting- place mentioned to be open to non· -Christians: strangers
might enter it 6111161 from cmiosity, or fiom sympathy‚ or from
malit-e to spy out what was going on. But as it is called συναγωγήν
ὑμῶν, it is evidently assumed that it was mainly under Christian
direction. The precise circumstances would of course vary from town
to town.

χρυσοδακτύλιος] ἁπ. λεγ. Lucian (Tum 20) uses χρυσόχειρ 111 the same
sense, and Epict. Β161ς i. 22 speaks of γερων χρυσοῦς δακτυλιους” εχωι
