clxxxvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAM Es

Aristophanes and Menander, but does not occur in their existing
remains. See below, notes on ii. 3, v, 12.

Ι go on now to Szsntactical Uses.

Tlce Aowle. We found J ames omitting this, contrary to Classical

usage, where the noun was defined by a possessive prononn, as in
i. 26 χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν ἑαυτοῦ, ἀπατῶν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ, v. 20
σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. This lieense, common in LXX., is very rare
in the other books of the N.T. except in the first two Chapters of
St. Luke and in quotations from the LXX., cf. Matt. xix. 28 ἐπὶ
θρόνου δόξης αὐτοῦ, Luke i. 15 ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, ver. 25
ἀφελεῖν ὄνειδός μου, ver. 51 ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ...διανοιά καρδίας
αὐτῶν, Heb. X. 16 ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν (fr. LXX.), Jude 14 ἐν ἁγίαις
μυριάσιν αὐτοῦ. See above, p. clxii. foll.

A similar lieense found in onr Epistle is the omission of the
article when the noun is defined by a genitive other than a
pronoun, as in i. 18 (ἱπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λόγῳ ἀληθείας, 11. 12 διὰ
s νόμου ἐλευθερίας κρίνεσθαι, 1. 20 ὀργὴ ἀνδρὸς δικαιοσύνην (θεοῦ
οὐκ ἐργάζεται. This is very common in the LXX. and occurs,I
think, in all the books of the N.T., especially after a preposition‚
eg. 1 Cor. i. 1 διὰ θελήματος Θεοῦ, il). ii. 15 τίς ἔγνω νοῦν Κυρίου,
ν1. 9 Θεοῦ βασιλείαν, x. 21 ποτήριον Κυρίου, Heb. x. 39 εἰς περι-
ποίησιν ψυχῆς, x. 28 ἀθετήσας νόμον ΝῙωυσέως, xii. 22 πόλει
Θεοῦ ζῶντος, ἐκκλησίᾳ πρωτοτόκων ἀπογεγραμμένων ἐν οὐρανοῖς,
The omission of the article with the attribute, as in ii. 8 νόμον
βασιλικόν, is less frequent except in the combination πνεῦμα
ἅγιονῑ we find it however in 1 Pet. i. 23 διὰ λόγου ζῶντος, 2 Pet.
ii. 5 ἀρχαίου κόσμου οὐκ ἐφείσατο, ver. 8 ψυχὴν δικαίαν ἐβασάνι-
ζεν, ver. 15 καταλείποντες εὐθεῖαν ὁδόν. See above p. clxiv. foll.

St. ‹James‘ use of the Pronoean is more idioinatic than is usual iu
the N .T. Ι cannot call to mind any other example of τις used,
like quidam, to soften what might seem a harsh or exaggerated
expression, as in i. 18 ἀπαρχήν τινα. We have also the double
interrogative ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην ἀνάπτει ‚· and the pregnant
use of ὅστις = ‘whereas' 111 1ν. 13, for which compare Acts xvii.
11 οὗτοι ἦσαν εὐγενέστεροι τῶν ἐν Θεσσαλονίκῃ, οἵτινες ἐδέξαντο
τὸν λόγον κ.τ.λ. ‘in that they received the wor‹l‚’ 271. vii. 53,
Rom. i. 25, Ρ1111. iv. 3 with Lightfoot's note, Winer p. 209 11., and
for examples from elassical, writers Isaeus vi. 43 εἰς τοῦτο ἀναιδείας
