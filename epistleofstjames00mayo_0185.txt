ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GRAMMAR OF sT. JAMEs clxi

If we wish to distinguish the shades of meaning attaching to
these different modes of qualifying the noun, (1) denotes the
final stage of thought by which the subject is combined with its
qualification so as to form one new complex subject; (2) gives the
definite subject first, and then adds its qualification as a second
thought3 (3) gives an indefinite subject first, and afterwards defines
it by its qualification: this has still more the air of a second
thought. Both (2) and (3) may serve a rhetorical purpose by
giving prominence to the qualification, which is to some extent
merged and lost in (1). The last (4) is the least artistic form, and
gives the mental impression in its first rough shape, unmodified by
the secondary action of the mind.

In these compound phrases the use of the article is also affected
by what may be called the Law of Correlation or Sympathy. If
one noun is dependent on another, tho article is, in general, used
either with both or with neither5 and thus, if the one noun can
dispense with the article, it is sometimes omitted with the other
also, even when, if it stood alone, the latter would naturally have
taken the article. Thus we have ἄνθος χόρτου 1. 10, not ἄνθος
τοῦ χόρτου, δοῦλος Θεοῦ i. 1, not δοῦλος τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀκροατὴς λόγου
i. 23, not ἀκροατὴς τοῦ λόγου, ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς, not τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
σφαγῆς or ἡμέρᾳ τῆς σφαγῆς, νόμον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας i. 25, διὰ
νόμου ἐλευθερίας ii. 123 SO ἔργα νόμου 01· τὰ ἔργα τοῦ νόμου, not
ἔργα τοῦ νόμου or τὰ ἔργα νόμου, Apparent exceptions niay
sometimes be explained (as v, 10 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, v, 11 τὸ
τέλος Κυρίου) by the fact that Κύριος is a proper name, the con-
struction being the same as in τὴν ὑπομονὴν Ἰώβ.

From the above uses of the article in an attributive phrase we
must carefully distinguish its use in predication‚ of which the type
is ἀγαθὸς ὁ ἀνήρ, the subject being known by the presence of the
article, the predicate by its absence, as in i. 26 τούτου μάταιος ἡ
θρησκεία, iv. 4 ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστίν. Hence
we characterize μακάριος ἀνήρ in i. 12 as a predicate <like τέλειος
ἀνήρ in iii. 2), ‘He is a blessed man who‚’ instead of dividing
them with the English Version and making ἀνήρ subject,
‘Blessed is the man! The same phrase is shown to be predica-
tive in Rom. iv. 8 (μακάριος ἀνὴρ οὗ οὐ μὴ λογίσηται ἁμαρτίαν)
by the preceding μακάριοι ὧν ἀφέθησαν αἱ ἀνομίαι. And so
θρησκεία καθαρά in i. 27 ‘this, viz. visiting widows and orphans,
