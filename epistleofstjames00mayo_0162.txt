The order of thought here is the following: the elders are not
to lord it over the younger3 the younger are to be subject to the
elder, or rather all are to serve one another, girding themselves
with humility. So far humility is an attitude of man towards
man: in what follows it is the attitude of man towards God.
God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble : if we humble
ourselves before him, he will exalt us in due time. It would seem
from the following clause that this exaltation refers. in the first
place, to the deliverance from temporal anxieties. The devil
appears in ver. 8 as the cause of these anxieties: he seeks to terrify
the Christians into apostasy3 but God will stablish and strengthen
them after a short period of suffering. It ean hardly be said that
“ the logical connexion is very strict in these verses. The admoni-
tion to the elders has little to do with withstanding the devil,
as the cause of their present anxieties; and humility towards
man does not seem quite the same thing as humility towards
God. ⁹

Now take the parallel passage in James: (iv, 1-3) quarrels come
from unsatisfied lusts; you are unsatisfied, because you either do
not ask of God, or you ask in a worldly spirit ; (ver. 4) the friend· ἕ
ship of the world is enmity with God3 whoever seeks the world’s ¹
friendship, thereby becomes the enemy of God3 (vv. 5-10) the
Spirit of God within us jealously demands the possession of our
whole heart‚ but gives all the more graec (in consequence of that
jealousy). Hence the Scripture says, ‘ God resists the proud (ie.
the worldly), but gives grace to the liunible.' Be subject therefore
to God, and withstand the devil (the prince of this world), and he
will fleo from you. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to
yon. Repent‚ and humble yourselves in the sight of God, and he
will exult you.
