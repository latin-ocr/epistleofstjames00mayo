SIN. (or Ν) ΟΟΒΕΧ SINAITICUS‚ discovered by Tischendorf in
the convent at Mount Sinai on Feb. 4, 1859, and published by
him in 1862. It is now in the library at St. Petersburg. It is
written continuously without stops 01· breathings. Contained
originally the whole of the Old Testament, including the Apocrypha
(of this a large portion is now wanting) 3 the New Testament <still
entire); the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas
(of this last a large part is lost). Errors from 116613111, 311611 63 1116
confusion of αι and ε, ει and ι, are frequent. Westcott and Hort
consider it the most valuable MS. after Β, giving in the main a
Pre-Syrian text but to a certain extent corrupted by western and
Alexandrian readings. Tischendorf, as was natural, codicem suzam 9⁴6
vom 2)raamantissimum fortasse plus coequo miratus esc (C. R. Gregory
Prol. to Tischendorf's N.T. p. 353), and has in some instances been
thus induced to prefer what seems to me an inferior reading. See
especially iii. 5, 6, where his text is ἰδοῦ ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην
ἀνάπτει ἡ νγλῶσσα. πῦρ, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας, ἡ «γλῶσσα καθίσ-
ταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ σπιλοῦσα ὅλον τὸ σῶμα καὶ φλο-
«γιζομένη xxm„ iv. 2 μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε. καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε διὰ
τὸ μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς· αἰτεῖτε κ.τ.λ.
