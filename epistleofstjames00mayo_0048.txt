than was possible in their case, as to the true nature of her Son, did
nevertholess on more than one occasion draw upon herself his
reproof for venturcd interference. If we remember how little even
those whom he chose out as his Apostles were able to appreciate
his aims and methods up to the very cnd of his life, how different
was their idea of the Kingdom of Heaven and the office of the
Messiah from His, we shall not wonder if his younger brothers, with

in knowledge of the world as it was, and needing the constant care
of his more practical friends to provide him with the ordinary
comforts and necessarics of life. Thus much, I think, is certain
from the known facts of the case3 and we need nothing more than
this to explain their sear that his mind might be overstrained, and
their attempt to dictate the measures he should adopt in going up
to the F east, just as his mother had attempted to dictate to him at
the marriage of Cana.

(3) Dealing with the argument from tradition, we must bcar in
mind that what we are in search of is historical fact. The accepted
historical belief at any given time depends, so far as the educated
minority is concerned, partly upon the critical interpretation of
supposed authentic documents by contemporary scholars, such as
Jerome in the fourth century, who regarded it as mere waste of
time to leave the Scriptures, the fountain of tuith, and follow
opinionum rivulos, the fancies of later writers who had no other
ground for their guesses than the Scriptores themselves (J er. Λᾶν.
Helv. 17). But even of the educated it is true to a certain extent,
as it is entirely true of the uneducated, that they take their
notions of history without inquiry either from the most popular
epitome or fron] what may be loosely called tradition. And tradi-
tion as it exists in any age will probably have some nucleus of fact,
but that nucleus is so transformed by the action of the imagination‚
and by the thoughts and feelings of the generations which have
passed since the actual occurrences of which it embalms the
memory‚ that we cannot trust it for details. Thus while we may
fully allow the interest and importancc which attach to the
thoughts and feelings of Cliristians in former agcs, yct for our
