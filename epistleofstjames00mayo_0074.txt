l THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

mitem. Augustino (Dc Doctrina Christiana, ii. 12), after giving 11
complete list of the sacred books, adds in lois omnibus libris limmate

in the third Oouncil of Carthago (397 A.D.), where 0111· present
Canon of Scripture received its first undoubted synodica] ratifica-
ti0n3 though this was not binding on the Eastern Church till it
was sanctioned by the Trullan or Quinisext Council of 692 A.D.
It will have been observed that, while the Churehes of Rome and
Carthago long doubted the canonicity of 1110 Epistle of St. J ames,
it was acknowledged from a very early period by the Churehcs of
Jerusalem and (probably) of Syria, and is included in the catalogues
of Sacrod Books which have 001110 down 10 115 from the Churches of
Egypt and Asia Minor. The difference is easily explained from
the fact that 1110 Epistle was probably written at Jerusalem and
addressed 10 1110 Jews of the Eastern Dispersi0n3 it did not
profess to be written by an Apostle or 10 be addressed to Gentile

proceeding from an inspired writer, if not an Apostle, yet one whose ,
words were 110 less weighty than those of an Apostle. Most of

a remarkable fact that our earliest witnesses belong to the Chureh
