common to the families. This objection is based on several
assumptions, one being that Mary the wife 01 Clopas was sister of
the Virgin Mary, which has been shown to be all but incredible.
But waiving this, why should it be thought improbable that three
of the commonest Jewish names should be found in two sets of
cousins? we have a greater variety of Christian names in ordinary
use in England than there were then in Judea, but no one would
think such a recurrence of names 111 any way remarkable or extra-
ordinary; in fact, so far as my experience goes, the improbability is
all the other way.

(2) When a certain Mary is described as ‘ the mother of ‹Jalnes’
we naturally assume that the J ames intended is the most celebrated
of the name, viz. the Lord’s brother. But we elsewhere find the
same Mary designated as mother of J oses (Mark xv. 47), or more
generally of James and Joses (Matt. xxvii. 56, Mark xv. 40), 50
that no stress can be laid upon this.

It appears then that-the Hieronymian theory is as weak in

attack as it 15 111 defence, and that if the Epiphanian theory is to es ss

be attacked with any prospect of success, it must be from the
Helvidian side, on the ground that it gives an artificial and non—
natural rendering of two passages of Scripture which we have still
to consider3 that it weakens the force of the narrative which we
have already considered, telling how the mother of J esus came with
his brothers to take him; and gives a less natural meaning to the
word ‘ brother.' The two passages yet to be considered are Matt. i.
24· Ἰωσὴφ...παρέλαβεν τὴν «γυναῖκα, αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν
αὐτὴν ἕως οὗ ἔτεκεν υἱόν, and Luke ii. 7 καὶ ἔτεκεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς
τὸν πρωτότοκον. Reading these in connexion with those other
passages which speak of the brothers and sisters of Jesus, it is
hard to believe that the Evangelists meant us to understand, or
indeed that it ever entered their heads that the words could be
understood to mean, any thing else than that these brothers were
sons of the mother and the reputed father of the Lord. It has
been attempted however to prove that we need not take the
passages referred to in their ordinary and natural sense. Thus
Pearson, treating of the phrase ἕως οὗ, tells us that ‘the manner of
the Scripture language produceth no such inference‚' as that, froin
a limit assigned to a negative, we may imply a subsequent affirma-
