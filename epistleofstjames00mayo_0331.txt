Greek would mean to accept the outside sui-face for the inner reality‚
the mask for the person,1 cf. Epict. Enclc. 17 μέμνησο ὅτι ὑποκριτὴς εἶ ’
δράματος οἴου ἂν θέλῃ ὃ διδάσκαλος...σὸν τοῦτ’ ἔστιν τὸ δοθὲν ὑποκρίνασθαι
πρόσωπον καλῶς. The plural of the abstract refers to the many ways
in which partiality may show itself, cf. below iv. 16 ἐν ἀλαζονίαις, 2 Pet.

ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν.] ⁶ Do not have your saith in persona] respects,' ‘ Do
not you, who call yourselves believers in Christ, disgrace your faith 11)]
exhibitions of partiality.⁷ WH. with marg. in RV. take ἔχετε as
indicative with a mark of interrogation, ‘Do ye, in accepting persons,
hold the faith‘l’ &c The interrogative rendering is also preferred 11)]
Stier, Schneckenburger, Kern, Gebser, Pott, and other connnentators.
I think it is simpler and more natural to take ἔχετε as imperative,
especially as it is the commencement of a new Section of the epistle,
and it is the manner of the writer to begin by putting each topic
for-ward clearly and explicitly, usually in the shape of a precept,
and afterwards to enforce and illustrate it in a variety of forms.
It certainly cannot be said that, taken interrogatively‚ the sentence
gives a clear, unmistakable meaning. At first sight it would
seem to suggest that those addressed are not guilty of respect of
persons. And the following γάρ, which, if we take ἔχετε as impera
tive, gives a warning against respect of persons, because it 15
shown by an example to involve worldly-mindedness and unrighteous
judgment, is hard to explain if we take ἔχετε as a question : (⁶ Can it
bc that you are guilty of partiality‘l For if you make distinctions in
your religious meetings you are not whole-hearted‚ but led away by ,Ἴ
worldly considerationsss) The imperative also suits better the 50110115-
ness of the writer and the opening words ἀδελφοί μου. F or ἐν express·- ⁵
ing the sphere of manifestation cf. above 1. 21 ἐν πραΰτητι, 1 Tim. i.
18 ἵνα στρατεύῃ ἐν αὐταῖς τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν. Μὴ ἔχετε is a more
personal way of putting μὴ ἔστω ἡ πίστις, implying free-will and
responsibility, cf. Max-k ix. 50 ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλας, Rom. x. 2 ζῆλον
Θεοῦ ἔχουσιν ἀλλ’ οὗ κατὰ ἐπίγνωσιν, below ii. IS σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις κάγὼ
ἔργα ἔχω.

πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ήμῶν.] For this objective genitive cf. Mark xi. 22

¹ Mr. Jennings 011 Psa. lxxxii. 2 says the chrew ‘wasa panim primarily 111-
volves the act of raising the face of another with the view of comfortiug him! If this
is 50, the meaning is entirely lost in the Greek translations aud a much more striking
idea substituted in its place 3 sce Lightfoot, Gal. ii. 6 “ in the O. T. it 15 a neutral
expression involving no subsidiary idea of partiality, and 15 11111011 osteum· found in a
good than in a bad sense. When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however,

the bad 501150 attaches to it owing to the secondary meaning os πρόσωπον as
‘a n1ask.'”
