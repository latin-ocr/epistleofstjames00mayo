clxxx THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

μή with, imperative i. 22 Γγίνεσθε ποιηταὶ καὶ μὴ ἀκροαταί.

μή with participle ιἰι imperative clause i. 5 αἰτείτω μηδὲν δια-
κρινόμενος.

μή ‘zeitli participle implyinq condition iv. 17 εἰδότι καλὸν ποιεῖν
καὶ μὴ ποιοῦντι ἁμαρτία ἐστίν. .

μή with participle in ιςἰιῖῃῗιιηοίιύι elause- depending on ἵνα i. 4 ἵνα
ἣτε τέλειοι ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι.

μή witli participle preceded by article ii. 13 ἡ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ
μὴ ποιήσαντι ἕλεος, where the reference is not to a particular
person but to a class, see Winer p. 606.

i. 5 αἰτείτω παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ πᾶσιν καὶ μὴ ὀνειδίζοντος.
Here we might suppose μή to be used with the participle because
the principal verb is imperative, as in Luke iii. 11 ὁ ἔχων δυὸ
χιτῶνας μεταδότω τῷ μὴ ἔχοντι (but this too is better explained
as generic, not lime qai non habet, but ei qni non habeat), ib. xix. 27
τοὺς ἐχθρούς μου τούτους τοὺς μὴ θελήσαντάς με βασιλεῦσαι
ἀγάγετε ὧδε (but here too I should rather take it as a clause in
apposition, referring τούτους to a certain type of men, ‘the fellows
that would not have me reign over the1n‚' net simply ‘ these men
who would not'); but Ι think it is better explained as in 2 Cor.
v. 21 τὸν μὴ «γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησεν ceam qui
‘non nosset peceatum pro nohis peccatam feeit, ‘ one whose character-
istic was sinlessness he made sin'; so here, ‘let him ask of God
whose characteristic it is to give to all without upbraiding.'

μή ἰ’νιΐιτγ9·09αΐιύο expedias] oiech‘ive aozszeeo' ii. 14 μὴ δύναται ἡ
πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν; iii. 11 μήτι ἡ πηνγὴ...βρύει τὸ Ὑλυκύ,· iii. 12
μὴ δύναται συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι ,·

οὔτε used for οὐδέ iii 12 οὕτε ἁλυκὸν «γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ.

OTHER ADVERBS AND PARTICLES.

c'irye interjectional, not found elsewhere in N.T.‚ occurs in the
LXX. and elassical authors, see note on iv, 13.

ἀλλ ά. In four passages it has its ordinary force of contrasting
a positive with a negative conception, as in i. 25 οὐκ ἀκροατὴς...
ἀλλὰ ποιητής, i. 26, iii. 15, iv, 11. In the remaining passage,
ii. 18 ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις, it appears to have the unusual force of the
Latin immo, adding emphasis to what has been already said; cf.

‚1 Pet. iii. 14 ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε διὰ δικαιοσύνην, μακάριοι, and
see, note ‘in loeo.
