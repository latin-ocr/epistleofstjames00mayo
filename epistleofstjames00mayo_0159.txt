ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxv

ver. 8, or 10 the pattcrn of pure religion depicted in i. 27. Is
this then an unusual sense of the word ἔρὙον 111 1110 Now
Testainent 2 Does it usually include a reference 10 strict ceremonial
observancc ’ἒ Would it bc naturally understood by Jews to include
this? In John viii. :39 the works of Abraham (73.0. his hospitality
dac„ Gen. xviii.) are contrasted with the murderous intentions of the
Jews3 in Apoc. xx, 12 we read that the dead will be judged κατὰ
τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, meaning of course the sanie as κατὰ τὴν ’πρᾶξιν
αὐτοῦ 111 Matt. xvi. 27, which is explained of works of love in
Matt. xxv. :34-46. So over and over again we find in the Apo-
calypse οἶδα τὰ ἕρνγα σου, referring. as the context shows, to moral
conduct. St. Paul, writing after St. James, finds it necessary to
distinguish the ἕρνγα πίστεως and the ἕρὙα ιὶνγάπης, 1110 natural
fruits of saith and love, from the ἕρνγα νόμου, dead works done
from slavish obedience to an external law.

Again Von Soden, like his school in general, exaggerates the
negative side of the Epistle: the writer, he says, ignores the
Resurrection. What does he make of the phrase τῆς δόξης 111 ii.
12 This surely involves the belief in the Resurrection and
Ascension and even 111 1110 Divinity of Christ.

The final result of his investigation is that the Epistle was
written at Rome during the reign of Domitian to Christians
generally. Beyschlag well asks, If so, what possible inducement
was there for the forger, who was certainly no sectarian, like the
author of the Clementines, but an orthodox believer, to inscribe his
letter with the name of James, rather than of Peter? and if he
was determined to choose James, what possible motive could he
have for using the modest description‘ servant ’ instead of ‘ brother ³
of the Lord J esus Christ 2

I will now take the most recent statement of the theory that the
Epistle was written in the second century. This is contained 111
W. Briickner's Dic clwonoloyisalw Bcz'lzcnfitlgsc cler Murenaincautelam
Bricfc, Haarlem, 1890.

According toliis view the only epistles written during the first century
were those 10 1110 Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Philemon, Pliilippimis,
Hebrews, and the lst to the Thessalonians. The first epistle of Peter was
written during the persecution under Trajan. As our epistle borrews from i t
and shows no traces of being written under stress of persecution, the latter
cannot be assigned to an earlier period than the reign of Hadrian. The

priority of Peter 10 J aines is proved as follows. The topics common to both
epistles are better expressed and more logically handled, the phrases used are
