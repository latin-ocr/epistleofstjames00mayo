Is this a new case, or another aspect of the case of the sick man‘.l
If the latter, it seems to imply strange sloth and lukewarmness on the
part of the Elders, that they should stand in need of exhortation to the
perforlnance of a duty, which would not have seemed to be particularly
arduous or irksome. The previous verses insist on their power to 11001
the disease and procure forgiveness by their prayers : 17. 20 speaks of
the reward. If, as seems more likely, it is a new case, St. -James may
have added it as an afterthought on finding that his warnings had
been chiefly against over-activity, too much vehemence, too much
eagerness to teach. In ver. 14 he had begun to speak of our duty
towards the sick in body 3 in ver. 16 110 had extended this into 0 general
precept 03 to mutual help in spiritual matters 3 in ver. 19 110 turns to the
case of the backsliders. Even here nothing is said as to the duty of
the Church to go out into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
creature 3 nothing is said as to making proselytes from the Gentiles or
even from the unbelieving Jews. It is the exhortation of the Bishop,
whose aim is the reformation and improvement of the Chumh, not of
the Apostle, whose aim is the extension of the Church by the diffusion
of the faith.

In my note I have pointed out that the words of ver. 20, ‘he who
recalls an erring brother saves (or ‘ will save ’) his soul from death and
will be the means of blotting out many sins’ are capable of two
interpretations, according to the reference we give to ‘ his.’ Ι 110νο
mentioned some difficulties which lie in the way of our taking ⁶ his' to
refer to the sinuer, and have shown that it was not uncommon with
Jewish writers to hold forth the prospect of salvation and forgive-
ness of sins, as an inducement to certain kinds of right conduct,
such as alms-giving. I postponed to the present occasion the
consideration of the question whether it was possible that St. James
should have adopted a similar mode of speaking. We cannot, of
course, imagine that he would ever have dreamt of a man's being
able to atone for his own sins by his assiduity in calling others to
repentance. Such 0 11011011 13 forbidden, not less by our Lord’s words
recorded in Matt. vii. 20-22 ‘ Many will say to me in that day, Lord‚
have we not prophesied in thy name'.l . . . then will I profess unto
them, I never knew you 3 depart from me, ye that work iniquity,' and
by the words of St. Paul in 1 Cor. xiii. 1—3, ‘Though Ι 3110011 with the
tongues of men and angels though Ι 110νο the gift of prophecy

110νο 11013 charity, it profiteth me nothing,' and in ch. iX. 26, 27 ‘ I keep
under my body and bring it into subjection, lest having preached to
others, I myself should be a castaway,'—than by the words of
St. James himself, ‘Be not many masters, knowing that we shall
receive the greater condemnation,' and by his constant depreciation of
mere speaking, unaccompanied by deeds and practice. St. J ames has
told us already how the soul is saved (i. 21-25) : not by preaching to
