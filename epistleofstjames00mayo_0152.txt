cxxviii THE EPISTL F„ OF ST. JAMEs

““··11101οῐ010, br‚ethien. ‚for the Coming of 1110 Lord is at 111111(ὶῖ Ι
f have my self referred to the 3111110 passage, as proving 111111 1110 writer

'¹⁴ ¹¹1¹¹¹³·' shared the belief expressed by St. Ρ11111 1111113 earlier Epistles as to

the immediate Coming of the Lord. It is in strong contrast with
the language used in 2 Peter iii. 3, 8: ‘ Knowing this, that iu 1110
11131 times mockers shall come...saying Where is the promise of his
coming? for from 1110 days that 1110 fathers fell asleep all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the creation '2 ‘ But
forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as
a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day? lt seems to
me that the words of St. J ames, while they prove his own expecta-
tion of the speedy appearance of the Lord, do not at all disprove
1110 3111110 expectation on the part of those whom he addresses. A
man might easily be impatient under continued ill-treatment, even
though 110 believed, as 1111 abstract dogma, that the J udge was soon
to appear. St. J ames urges him to make it a living truth‚ affecting
his daily practice. A fourth argument 13 that founded on the
discussion about saith and works, which Archdeacon Farrar thinks
‘finds its most reasonable explanation in the supposition that he
is striving to remove the (langerous inferences to which St. Paul's
doctrine of justification by saith was liable? The difficulty as to the
absence of any reference to the subject debated in the Oouncil of
Jerusalem is got over by the assumption that ‘the circumcision
question was speedily forgotten.' On these points I have already
said all that I think necessary.l
' I turn now to other arguments adduced by Dr. Davidson. He is

5⁰ of opinion that ‘ the direction to send for the elders of the Church,

,⁰¹¹ and their use of oil with the prayer of faith, savours of a post-
,η .(,3 apostolic time? Why? The Apostles made use of 011 111 healing
'w the sick (Mark vi. 13), and any Jewish community would be under
1¹ αἶψ’ 1110 direction of elders. But ‘the office of elder was originally con-

fined to the Church's outer guidance,' and here ‘ the office of elder-
ship is separated from the members of the Church, a thing which
‹lid not exist in primitive Clu·istianity.’ The meaning is not very
clearly expressed. If certain members of the Church were chosen
to hold tho office of elder, they were ipso sarto separated from the

other members of the Church ; and spiritual functions are certainly
implicd in 1 Thess. V. 12-14, 1 Pet. v, 2, and in Acts xx. 17 and 28.
