would suit the passage well, but is hard to get out of the word. Why may we
npt ‘suppose parties in the Churches of the Diaspora, as in the Church of
(1on 2.—He reads φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε without a stop.

IV. 3.—He reads δαπανήσετε with B for δαπανήσητε, the reading of the other
MSS. accepted by WH.

IV. 5.—In this difficult verse Weiss makes πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ τὸ πνεῦμα ὃ
κατῴκισεν ἐν ἡμῖν, μείζονα δέ δίδωσιν χάριν parenthetie, and takes τὸ πνεῦμα as·
object of ἐπιποθεῖ. Ι have stated in my notes my reasons against this way of
taking the passage.

IV. 9.—He here reads μετατραπήτω with BP and WH.

IV. 10.—He reads τοῦ before Κυρίου against the best MSS. and edd.

IV. 14— He reads with WH. τῆς αὔριον ποία ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν. Ι have stated in
my note why I prefer the reading of Sin. If a change is to be made I should
rather give the exact reading οἵ Β, omitting the article before ζωή. ln the
ξιτὲιετ part of the verse Weiss departs from B and WH. by inserting the article

e ore π ός.

IV. 15ρ.-Ηθ departs from B and WH. by reading θελήσῃ for θέλῃ.

V. 3.—-He puts a full stop after πῦρ in opposition to WH.

V. 6.—He departs from WH. by reading ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν without a question.

V. ll.—He omits ὁ before κύριος with Β and WH.m

V. 12.—He refers the wearing, which is here forbidden, to the asseveration
of innocence made before the judges *of verse 6. He writes τὸ ναὶ ναί (not, as
WH., τὸ Ναί ναὶ) translating it ‘ Let your yea be yea‚' ιε. perfectly straight-
forward, so as not to need the confirmation of an oath.

V. 13.—He reads κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν without an interrogation, and so
ἀσθενεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν in verse 14.

V. lat—He departs from B by keeping τοῦ Κυρίου after ὀνόματι, in spite of
the variations of the other MSS.

V. 15.—He follows Huther in translating κᾶν ‘even if!

V. 16.—He reads τὰς ἁμαρτίας with WH. and the best MSS„ and understands
ἰάθητε of bodily healing (comparing Gen. XX. 17, Exod. xv. 26) which could
only be effected after the sin, which had caused the disease‚ had been confessed
and. forgiven. He thinks that πρεσβύτεροι means simply the older menibers of
the Christian community‚ who, as being the most experienced‚ would be sent
for in the first instance, but that the same duty devolved upon all. He takes
ἐνεργουμένη as middle, ‘hinsichtlich seiner Wirksamkeit.’

V. 20—He reads γινώσκετε with WH. and B. In the latter part of the verse
he reads σώσει ψυχὴν ἐκ θανάτου αὐτοῦ With B, where WH. have σ. ψυχὴν
αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου with Sin. P. Surely if B‘s order were right, we must have
had αὐτῆς, to suit the preceding ψυχήν. Weiss understands the sins which are
hidden to be those of the c01n·erted person.
