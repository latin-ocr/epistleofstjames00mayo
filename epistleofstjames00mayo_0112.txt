lxxxviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Gentile converts before the Church of Jerusalem. More particu-
larly would this be so, if any phrases in the epistle could be
turned against his own doctrine of justification by saith, by those
who maintained that ‹Jew and Gentile alike could only be justified
by tho works of the law. It has been justly reinarked that the
words ‘whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all' (James ii. 10) might easily be twisted by
the Judaizers so as to represent St. Jaines as insisting on the
observance of the whole Mosaic code ; and that it is perhaps this
misinterpretation which is referred to in the words ‘ we have heard
that certain which went out from us troubled you saying, Ye must
be circumcised and keep the law, to whom we gave no such com-
mandment' (Acts xv. 24).1 On the other hand there is much less
likelihood of St. Paul’s Epistles, addressed to distant churches and
dealing so much with persona] questions, being brought under the
notice of St. James. That there is a connexion between the
epistles of the two men, has been the general belief in the Church
from the time of Augustine downwards; but this connexion has
been usually explained on the supposition that James meant
either directly to controvert Paul's own teaching, or at any rate to
put forward considerations which might serve to restrain the ex-
travagances of his followers. It has been pointed out however by
the more careful students of our Epistle‚ such as Neander and
Bp. Lightfoot, that the argument therein contained on Faith and
Works has no bearing on St. Paul's doctrine, its purport being, in
the words of John Bunyan‚ to insist that ‘ at the Day of Doom, men
shall be judged according to their fruit. It will not be said then
Did you believe? but, I‘Vcre you doers or talkcrs only? ‘For as
the body without the soul is but a dead carcase, so scepsius), if it be
alone, is but a dead carcase also ’—a doctrine which of course is
common to St. Paul, as to every other writer in the N.T.

But it does not follow, as some have maintained, that because
our Epistle gives no answer to St. Paul's argument addressed to the
Romans, there is therefore no connexion between them. I think
it is impossible to read carefully the passages given below, without
feeling that the one writer copied from the other; and that, while
St. Jamcs has no reference to St. Paul, St. Paul on the contrary
writes with constant reference to St. Jaines, sometimes borrowing
