have endeavoured to show the improbability of this theory in the
case of one small Epistle. Others have done the same for other
nbooks of the New Testament. But the improbability attaching to

omlmjrty the theory as affecting one or another separate book of the N ew

3511‹{ersm Testament 1s as nothing in comparison with the combined impro-
mssgfanoede bability of one half of the books having been forg'ed 1n the second

century. For consider the demand thus made upon us. We have
on the one side a century which beyond all question witnessed the
greatest advance in morality and religion which has ever taken
place on this earth. Is this advance ¹is to be explained by natural
causes we must assume the existence of extraordinary powers,
spiritual, moral and intellectual, in the men by whom it was brought
about. The histories of the time, written by contemporaries, as we
believe—at any rate written, as even our opponents admit, within a
hundred years, more or less, of the events which they record—tell

and vividly that we seem to be personally acquainted with them.
Again we have letters purporting to 116 written by some of these
men, which 36 fully answer the expectations excited by the histories
and soar so high above the ordinary level of human thought, that
they have for some eighteen centuries been regarded by the most
enlightened os mankind as containing, along with the histories, a
divine ideal and an inspired rule of conduct for the whole human

and from the undisputed writings of the time, was decidedly
wanting in power and ability, not merely in comparison with the
first, but in comparison with most of the later centurieS. Yet it is
in this feeble age that Baur and 1113 followers have sought to find
the authors of the books which bear, and in the judgment of united
Christendom worthily bear, the great names of J ames, Peter, Paul,
and John. It is not one author of this inspired stamp they are
in search of, but four at least ; for there is no pretence that any
one individua! could have produced works so diverse in doctrine,
thought and style ; nay, their separatist hypotheses make it
necessary for them to assume a fifth, a sixth, and even a seventh
author. And yet not a trace of one of them is to be found in 5
the history or literature of the second century. No one is bold ’
