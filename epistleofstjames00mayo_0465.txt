III 1—12 USE AND ABUSE OF SPEEOH 205

though each fully allows and even asserts the doctrine complementary
to that which may be called peculiarly his own.

III. 1—12. Paraphrase.

Do not be eaqer to assume the responsibilities of teaehers. H ard as
it is for man to avoid stmnbliny in aetion, it is harder still to avoid
it in speech ; so that to quide the tonyue ariyht may be reqarded as
a test of Christian maturitgs. As the movements of the horse or the
ship are controlled by the little bit in the mouth or rudder in the stern,
so the whole activity of man is directed by the use made of the tonyue.
Like the sparh which sets the forest on fire, the tonyue, by some little
insiqnifleant word, ean boast of setting] on fire the wheel of mortality,
the whole round of this mortal life. In the mieroeosm of man’s
nature the tonyue represents the unrigshteous world, and is used by
Satan as his oryan. Man has learnt to tame the most savaye and
venomous of animals, but the tonyue is mitameable and never at rest,
and its venom is the deadliest of all. It is as impossible to combine
aeeeptable worship of God with imprecations on man, God's imaye, as
it is impossible for a fountain to send forth sweet and bitter water at
the same orifiee, or a tree of one speeies to bear fruit of another
speeies. (See especially notes on verses 8, 10.)

UsE AND ABUSE or SPEECH.

The teacher here referred tois of course, in the first instance, the
teacher in the congregation. It is the same warning as we read in i.
19 3 the same also as is given by St. Paul in 1 Cor. xiv. 26—40. From
the latter passage we learn that the Christian assemblies were often
soenes of great confusion, in which a number of persons, women as
well as men, were trying to make themselves heard at the same times
one with a psalm, one with a revelation, one with a teaching‚ and so
on, St. Paul insists that those who prophesy‚ or speak with unknown
tongues, should speak by two or at the most by three (with which we
may compare the μὴ πολλοί of St. J ames), and that by course, so that all
things may be done decently and in order. It does not seem that there
was any distinct order of teachers : each member of the congregation
was at liberty to speak as he was moved by the Holy spirit, in accordance
with the prophecy of J oel, quoted by St. Peter on the day of Pente-
cost. But even the exercise of the gifts of the Spirit was to be kept
under control 3 the spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets :
there was to be nothing orgiastic in the Christian service. If there
- was anything of mere animal excitement, of pushing, or display, or
want of consideration for others, this was a sign that the speaker
was not exclusively influeneed by the Spirit of God (vv. 14, 15). The
