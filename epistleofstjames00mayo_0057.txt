and giving to them a non—natural sense? This question I shall
endeavour to answer in the next section.

¹ (4) It is ‘the tendency,' says Dr. Mill (Lo. p. 301), ‘of the {¹333ssss
Christian mystery, God manifest in the fiesh, when heartily Ogffggffiltlo
received, to generate an unwillingness to believe that the womb senthssent·
thus divinely honoured should have given birth to other merely

human progeny.’ ‘The sentiment of veneration for this august

vessel of grace which has ever animated ChristianS...could not

have been wanting to the highly-favoured Joseph? ‘On the
impossibility of refuting these sentiments...the truly Catholic
Christian will have pleasure in reposing.' So Epiphanius, J erome,

and other ancient writers speak of this as a ‘ pious belief,' and the

same is reiterated by Hammond and J eremy Taylor cited by Mill

(p. 309). In answer to this I would say that unless we are pre-

pared to admit all the beliefs of the mediaeval Church, we must

beware of allowing too much authority to pious opinions. Is there

any extreme of superstition which cannot plead a ‘pious opinion'

in its favour? Of course it is right in studying history, whether , Dans-eros

sacred or profane, to put ourselves in the position of the actors, to {fifflssffffifflss‘}

imagine how they must have felt and acted; but this is not quite assifieixffligrio
the same thing as imagining how we ourselves should have felt and
acted under their circumstances, until at least we have ‹lone our
best to strip off all that differentiates the mind of one century from
the mind of another. If we could arrive at the real feeling of
Joseph in respect to his wife, and of Mary in respect to her Son
before and after his birth, this would undoubtedly be an element of
the highest importance for the determination of the question before
us: but to assume that they must have felt as a monk, or nun, or
celibate priest of the Middle Ages ; to assume even, with Dr. Mill,
that they fully understood the mystery ‘God manifest in the flesh,'
is not merely to make an unauthorized assumption, it is to assume

what is palpably contrary to fact.
