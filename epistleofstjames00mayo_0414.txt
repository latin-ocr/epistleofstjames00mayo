154 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

cause of his misfortu11es, Levit. xxiv. 15 ἅνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν καταράσηται
Θεὸν ἁμαρτίαν λήμψεται, ὀνομάζων δὲ ὄνομα Κυρίου θανάτῳ θανατούσθω.
This prohibition gave riso to a. variety of forms of swearing in which
the name of God was not expressed, see Matt. V. 35, 36, xxiii. 16-22,
Philo Spec. Leyss. M. 2. p 271 ‘if a man must ¹wear, let him not swear
by God, but by the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the heaven)
Elsewhere however Philo gives the higher view (M. 2. p. 184) κάλλιστον
δὴ καὶ βιωφελέστατον καὶ ἅρμοττον λογικῇ φύσει τὸ ἀνώμοτον, οὕτως
ἀληθεύειν ἐφ1 ἑκάστου δεδιδαγμένῃ ὡς τοὺς λόγους ὅρκους εἶναι νομίζεσθαι·
δεύτερος δὲ πλοῦς τὸ εὐορκεῖν, il). p. 271 οὐ πίστεως ἡ πολυορκία τεκμήριον
ἀλλ’ ἀπιστίας ἐστὶ παρὰ τοῖς εὖ φρονοῦσιν, and he goes on to point out
tho motives, such as hatred, which often lead to swearing. similarly
the Essenos are said to have forbidden all swenring, Joseph. BJ. ii. 8.
G πᾶν τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑπ’ αὐτῶν ἰσχυρότερον ὅρκου, τὸ δὲ ὀμνύειν περιίστανται χεῖρόν
τι τῆς ἐπιορκίας ὑπολαμβάνοντες, So Philo M. 2. p. 4583 hence Herod
exoused their taking the oath of allegiance (Jos. Ant. xv. 10. 4). It is
difficult to reconoile with this what ‹Iosephus says of the oaths they
had to take in the course of initiation (BJ. ii. 8. 7). So the ancient
Greeks, see Pythag. ap. Diog. L. viii. 22 μὴ ὀμνύναι θεοὺς, ἀσκεῖν γὰρ
αὑτὸν δεῖν ἀξιόπιστον παρέχειν, Diod. Sic. x. fr. 16, Epicb. Enelc. 33, Cf.
Wetst.. on Matt. v. 37, and the story told of Xenocrates (Cic. pro
Balb. 5) cum jurandi causa ad aras accederet una voce onmes judices
oze is juraret reclcmnasse.

St. Augustino has some inteiesting iemarks on this verse (1581 m

of a sermon, but as it came in the lesson for the day he felt it
his duty to offer some explzzmition. He sees no harm in oaths if
it were not for the danger of committing perjury. They are some-
times required iu order to induce belief of an important mattel, but
