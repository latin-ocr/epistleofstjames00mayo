THE AU'rHoR xxiii

which there is no evidence, was at any rate to be changed in a day
or two into the closest union with all true followers of the Lord 3
and as the preparation for this change must have been long per-
ceptible to the eye of JeS11s3 it seems necessary to find another way
of meeting the objection, isit is to be met at all. Ι think however
that Bp. Lightfoot goes a little too far when he speaks just below of
this hypothesis requiring us to believe that the mother, though
‘ living in the same city ' with her sons ‘ and joining with them in a
common worship (Acts i. 14),ss consigned to the care osa stranger,
of whose house she becomes henceforth the inmate.' We have
seen that there is reason for believing Salome to have been
the sister of Mary, and John therefore her nephew3 but however
this may be, in any case, as her Son's dearest friend, he must have
been well known to her. And if we try to picture to ourselves
the circumstances of the case, it is not difficult to imagine contin-
gencies which would make it a very natural arrangement. It is
generally supposed (from 1 Cor. ix. 5) that the brothers of the Lord
were married men: the usual age for marriage among the Jews was
about eighteen ι supposing them to have been born before the visit
to the Temple of the child Jesus, they would probably have married
before his Crucifixion. If then all her children were dispersed in
their several homes, and if, as we naturally infer, her nephew John
was unmarried and living in a house of his own, is there anything
unaccountable in the Lord's mother finding a home with the
beloved disciple? Oould this be regarded in any way as a slight
by her other sons 2 Must they not have felt that the busy lise of
a family was not suited for the quiet pondering which now more
than ever would characterize their mother? and further that this
communion between the Mother and the Disciple was likely to be
not only a source of comfort to both, but also most profitable to

the Church at lalge 2

those who had grown up with one like Jesus, must have felt such
love and reverence for him, that they could never dream of blaming

or criticizing what he thought best to do. Yet we know that his
