and J erome make the Apocryphal Gospels responsible for the theory
afterwards defended by Epiphanius. I think therefore we may
conclude that, setting aside these GospeIS, there was no fixed
recognized tradition on the subject before the end of the fourth
century, though there was a growing feeling in favour of the per-
petual virginity‚ which took definite shape in the title ἀειπαρθένος
used of Mary by Athanasius3 and the apocryphal fictions were
eagerly embraced as affording a support for this belief.1

A short abstract of the argument of Epiphanius will show us
the grounds on which he relied, and will also furnish an interesting
specimen of tradition in the making. It is contained in the third

book of his szarium, Haer. lxxviii. (Ayaiust clm Advm=smos of
llIa‘ry) p. 1037 foll.

In this age of heresy, he says, while 501115 have ventured to propagate
errors about the Trinity, others have turned their assaults against τῆς ἁγίας
Μαρίας, τῆς ἀειπαρθένου. Surely her very name is enough to confute them.
As Abraham is always the Friend of God, James and John always Sons of
Thunder, so Mary always the Virgin. The assertion that she ever ceased to
be a virgin shows a want of knowledge of Scripture and of history. For first
of all it was determined by lot that she should be delivered to Joseph, a
widower of eighty years, for the purpose of protection, not of marriage.2 This
5 oseph was brother of Clopas and son of Jacob surnamed Panther. His first
wife was of the tribe of 5 udah and by her he had six children, the eldest Jacob,
surnamed oblias and J nst, the first to whom the Lord entrusted the
episcopal throne, then J oses, Simeon, J udas, Mary, and Salome as we learn
from Scripture (p. 1041). Epiphanius then lays stress on the 1155 of the word
μιιηστευθείσης not γαμηθείσης, and argues that a just man, such as 5 oseph is
described to be, 0115 too who is still honoured as a pattern of virginity‚ could
never have regarded as his wife her who was the chosen vessel of the Holy
Ghost. The Holy Family returned froin Egypt when 555115 was four years
old; and not long afterwards Joseph died. If he had been still alive or if
Mary had had children of her own, would 555115 have entrusted her to
John at the Crucifixion2 And why is she called mother of John? Surely
because she is μήτηρ ἀρχηγὸς τῆς παρθενίας. Nothing is said as to the Virgin's
death, but it does not seem that 5115 accompanied St. 501111 to Ephesus, What
does this silence intimate 2 Ι tremble almost to say it, but in the Apocalypse
(xii. 13> Ι read ‘the dragon persecuted the woman which brought forth the
man child, and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
might fly into her place.' May not this have been fulfilled in the ΗΟ] y Virgin,
so that she never tasted of death 2 Again let us give heed to the lessons of
Nature. Science tells us that the lioness can only bring forth once, and Christ
is the lion of the tribe of Judah. 51111155, the eldest son of 5 oseph, died in his
