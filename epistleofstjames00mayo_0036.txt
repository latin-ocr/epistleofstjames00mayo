xii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

This inferenco, which we naturally draw from the words of St.
Mm-k, is confirmed by the express statement of St. John (vii. 3—5),
οὐδὲ Γγὰρ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστευον εἰς αὐτόν, and by our Lord's
words addressed to them (ver. 7), οὐ δύναται ὁ κόσμος μισεῖν
ὑμᾶς· ἐμὲ δὲ μισεῖ, ὅτι ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ αὐτοῦ ὅτι τὰ ἔρνγα
αυτοῦ πονηρά ἐστιν. Compaie this with the words spoken
shortly afterwards to the disciples (XV. 19), εἰ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου
ἠτε, ό κόσμος ἂν τὸ ἴδιον ἐφίλει· ὅτι δὲ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου οὐκ ἔστε,
αλλ’ ἐγὼ ἐξέλεξα υμᾶς ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου, διὰ τοῦτο μισεῖ ὑμᾶς ὁ
κόσμος. Ι defer the question as to the cause and nature of the
unbelief imputed to the Lord's brothers, and the cause of their
subsequent conversion. I simply note here that in vii. 3 they are
represented as making a distinction between themselves and the
disciple s, and that 1n vv, 5—'7 they are said to be on the side of the
world against Christ. I think my readers will aglee that the argu-
ment derived from St. Paul’s words must be one of great force if
it is to overthrow the combined evidence of so many passages, all
showing that Christ's brothers were not included in the Twelve.

ςῑμῂῑιι μὴ Ἰάκωβον τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ Κυρίου. Bishop Lightfoot in his
(ΜΗ 19' note discusses whether this should be translated, ‘I saw no other
Apostle save dames? or, ‘ I saw no other Apostle, but only James.'
He gives instances to show that εἰ μὴ may have the latter force,
(ιφ Luke iv. 27, πολλοὶ λεπροὶ ἦσαν ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἐλισαίου
τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν ἐκαθαρίσθη εἰ μὴ Νααμὰν ὁ Σύρος,

is that, whereas, according to the ordinary use, εἰ μὴ introduces an
exception to a general statement applicable to ‚all the members of
the class to which the excepted case belongs, in the instances
cited the excepted case is not included in the foregoing class.
It appears to be originally a colloquial use, and is employed with
comio effect in Arist. Eq. 185, &c Thus here Naaman was not
one of the many lcpers in Israel; they who are written in the

book of Lifr are not included among those who are guilty of
