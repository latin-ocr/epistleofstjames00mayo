1:34 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

eeding verse. Morem-01- such a division spoils both sentences: and all
commentators are now agreed that πρὸς φθόνον can only be taken with
ἐπιποθεῖ.

(2) scarcely less unanimous is the opinion of modern schola-rs that
Theophylact„ Oeeumenius and Euthymius were right in taking πρὸς φθόνον
as equivalent to φθονερῶς. Others have understood πρός to mean ‘against‚’
((ι) as Uyril above and the second interpreter in Bede, with Luther,
Bengel, Pott, Stier and Lange in later times But πρός can only mean
‘ against’ when joined with a word which ilnplies hostility: it cannot
have this force when joined with a word which implies strong affection
like ἐπιποθεῖ.1 (b) Others again understand πρός to mean ‘towards ' or
⁶ with a view to,' as Bcde above, ‘ Does the Spirit desire that you should
he envious one of another 'l' Calvin ‘ Is the spirit of God disposed to
envy ‘l’ so too Bloomfield: Beza and Estius translate ⁴ spiritus humanus
ad invidiam proclivis: Bouman after Wolf and WVitsius ‘Does the spirit
move you to envy‘l' As to this interpretation, while it may be granted
that ἐπιποθεῖ is occasionally followed by πρὸς in Hellenistic writers (as
in Psa. xlii. l quoted above), this is only allowable in describing warm
affection towards a person, never in speaking of a tendency to a certain
state of mind. still less can ἐπιποθεῖ have the causative force assigned
to it hy Wolf.

(c) Others take πρός to mean ‘up to,' Lat. usque, as the third inter-
preter in Bede quoted above, and von Soden ‘ bis zur Eifersucht liebt
er den Geist.' Praetically this is much the same as the correct interpreta-
tion, but the former is without precedent, while the latter is in accord-
ance with analogy, and Hows naturally from the ordinary use of πρός
to express ‘in conformity with)

(d) Michaelis and Seniler translate ‘in reference to envy‚' connecting
it with λέγει. This interpretation is open to the objections stated
under (l .

(3) 13ng, Cyril, Methodius and Euthymius rightly regard τὸ πνεῦμα
(the Divine Spirit) as the subject of ἐπιποθεῖ. Others make ἡ γραφή the
subject, as Theophylact‚ Oecumenius, and in later times Gebser and
Theile (a). Others, as Kern and Wiesinger, take God to be the
subject understood and τὸ πνεῦμα (the human spirit) the object (b).
Practically there is not much difference between these interpretations
and that which I regard as the right one. Of the two (b) has far inore

¹ lta-seh however thinks this possible. He rsgards these, words as a quotation
from a lost llelnrew gospvl (p. 256), ol' which he finds another rendering in Gal. v. 17
τὸ πνεῦμα (ἐπιθυμεῖ) κατὰ τῆς σαρκός. Dr. Taylor notes that in l‘sa. cxix. 174 the
Helu-ew word translated ‘I have longed’ (AN.) is variously rendered ἐπεπόθησα
(Lxx. ) and ὑπερεπεθύμησα (Syrum.) Ile further notes thatin ver. 20, where the Lxx.
hus ἐπεπόθησεν ἦ ψυχή μου τοῦ ἐπιθυμῆσαι τὰ κρίματά σου, the Hvbrew construction
uould hc inore lim-ally rendered εἰς ἐπιθυμίαν, and that the Hebr. ἎΝΠ, thore
translated ἐπιθ. and used in a good sense, is translated by βδελύσσομαι in Ainos vi. 8
(βδ. πᾶσαν τὴν ὕβριν Ἰακώβ). He suggests too that iu an original Hebrew phrase to
ih·- vtl'ect ‘the Spirit which he made to dwell *in this tlesh’ the word translated ‘in’
(2) might also be translated ‘against‚' as where it is used aster a verb meaning to
euvy in Gen. xxx. 1, Numb. v. 14 I'sa. xxxvii. 1, lxxiii. 3. Still this leaves
several steps wanting before we could accept Resch's vicw.
