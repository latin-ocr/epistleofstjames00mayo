xxviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

. . . merito indignatas est. Transtulit sanqzcinis nomina in alios qnos
massis proa'iinos pro side judicaret . . . in semet ipso docens qni patrem
aut ymno-cm (eatsratrcs proponeret verbo Dei non esse ctiynain discipa-
lnm (Ad. Mare. iv. 19). Similarly‚ arguing from the same text against
the Marcionite Apelles, he says ‘the words are not inconsistent
with the truth of his humanity.' No one would have told him that
his mother and brethren stood without, qni non certus esset habere
illam matrem et fratres . . . Fratres Domini nen erediderunt in illum
. . . Alam· acqzw non demonstratur adhaesisse ei, enm sulm-tha et
Marta alia in commercio ejas firqaentantnr. Hoc deniqne in loeo
apparet inerednlitas eormn (De Carne Christi 7). As Tertulliani in
these passages gives no liint that the brothers of Jesus are less
truly related to him ‘than his mother, so in other treatises he
takes it for granted that she ceased to be a virgin after the birth
of Christ (De Illonoyamia 8) : dnae nobis antistites Christianae sane-
titatis occurrunt, monogamia et continentia. Et Christum quidem
virffo enioea est, semel naptara post partam,1 (‘ being about to defer
her marriage union till after the birth of her Son,' lit. ‘being
about to marry first after her delivery ⁷) ‘at uterque titulus saneti-
tatis in Christi sensa dispunyeretnr per matrem et virqineon et nni-
viratn ; and in even plainer terms (De Viry. Vel. 6), where he discusses
the meaning of the salutation benedicta tn inter mulieres. ‘ Was
she called mittier and not viryo because she was espoused? We
need not at any rate suppose a prophetie reference to her future
state as a married woman ' : non enim poterat posteriorem mulierem
nominare cte qna Christus nasei non habebat, id cst viram passam,
sert illa (illam ?) qnae erat praesens, qnae erat viryo (‘ for the Angel
could not be referring to the wife that was to be, for Christ was
not to be born of a wife, i.e. of one who had known a husband,
but he referred to her who was before him, who was a virgin ').
These words of Tertullian, himself strongly ascetie, which were
written about the end of the second century, do not betray any
consciousness that he is controverting an established tradit-ion in
favour of the perpetual virginity ; nor do the words of Basil cited
before suggest anytlning of the sort even in the fourth century: he
only bears witness to a prevailing sentiment which he thinks
‹leserves consideration. We may remember also that both Origen

7), qnod asserunt eam nupsisse post partam, uncte approbent non liabent.
