52 TIIE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἐκπληρώσεις ἡ ἐν τῷ κινεῖσθαι· διὸ καὶ χείρων, ib. 74 sensation (αἴσθησις)
itself is passive, it becomes active when the reason (νοῦς) attaches
its-clf to it, then you may see its old potentia] existence (δύναμιν καθ’
ἕξιν ἠρεμοῦσαν) changed into an ἀποτέλεσμα and ἐνέργειαν, Philo M. 1.
p. 211 (tho thought of niul-der constitutes guilt) τῆς γνώμης ἴσον τῷ
τελείω δυναμένης. ἔως μὲν γὰρ τὰ αἰσχρὰ μόνον ἐννοοῦμεν κατὰ ψιλὴν τοῦ
νοῦ &turreio-(av, τότε τῆς διανοίας ἐσμὲν ὕποχοι· δύναται γὰρ καὶ ἀκουσίως ἡ
ψυχὴ τρέπεσθαι· ὅταν δὲ προσγένηται τοῖς βουλευθεῖσιν ἡ πρᾶξις, ὑπαίτιον
γίνεται καὶ τὸ βουλεύσασθαι· τὸ γὰρ ἑκουσίως διαμαρτάνειν ταύτῃ μάλιστα
διαγνωρίζεται, Hermas Mand. iv. 2 ἡ ἐνθύμησις αὕτη Θεοῦ δούλῳ ἁμαρτία
μεγάλη· ἐὰν δέ τις ἐργάσηται τὸ ἔργον τὸ πονηρὸν τοῦτο, θάνατον ἑαυτῷ
κατεργάζεται, Arist. Iliso. Anim. ix. 1 (the distinctive characteristics of
the sexes are shown at their fullest development in the human species)
τοῦτο γὰρ ἔχει τὴν φύσιν ἀποτετελεσμένην ὥστε καὶ ταύτας τὰς ἕξεις εἶναι
φανερωτέρας ἐν αὐτοῖς.

The verb κύω 01· κυέω, in the sense of to be or to become
pregnant, is common in older Greek, e.g. Il. ψ. 266 κυέουσαν,
Plato Theaec. 151 Β (111 reference to the Socratic μαιευτική) ὑποπτεύων
σε ὠδίνειν τι κυοῧντα ἔνδον. The aorisb of the shorter form is used
transitively (meaning ‘to impregnate’) in Aesch. fr. 38 ὄμβρος ἔκυσε
γαῖαν, and in the middle (meaning ‘to conceive') Hes. Theoq. 405.
Hence Hermann wished to limit the use of κύω 130 the male, κυέω 130 the
female, but Lobeck (Aj. p. 182 foll„ Parae. p. 556) shows that this
distinction is not borne out by MSS. or grammarians. Eustathius even
states the opposite κύειν τὸ κατὰ γαστρὸς ἔχειν, κυῶ δὲ τὸ γεννῶ, ὅθεν οἱ
κυήτορες, καὶ ἐκύει ἤγουν ἐγέννησε (p. 1548. 20, cited by Lob. Aj. 182).
The compound is only found here and below, ver. 18, in N.T. It is used
metaphorically ip 4 Mace. 15. 14 ὦ μόνη γυνὴ τὴν εὐσέβειαν ὁλόκληρον
ἀποκυήσασα, ‘ having given birth to piety in perfection.' It is common
in Philo, Plutarch and the later authors generally. For the force of
ἀπό (denoting cessation) cf. ἀπαλγέω, ἀπελπίζω, ἀποπονέω. For the
thought cf. Rom. vi. 21—23‚ viii. 6, Matt. vii. 13-14, where the
parallel between the two ways leading to death and life (the δύο ὁδοί of
the Didache and of Barnabas, 18. 1) is similarly brought out. The
issue of sin is seen most plainly in sins of the body leading to bodily
disease, but also in the deterioration of mind and character which
accompanies every kind of sin, till the man is said to be νεκρὸς τοῖς
παραπτώμασιν (Eph. ii. l).

16. μὴ πλανᾶσθε ἀδελφοί μου.] ‘ Be not mistaken ε not tempta-tion but
all that is good comes from Go‹·1.’ Of. Matt. xxii. 29 πλανᾶσθε μὴ εἰδότες
τὰς γραφάς, Luke xxi. 8 βλέπετε μὴ πλανηθῆτε. St. Paul uses the phrase
μὴ πλανᾶσθε, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 15. 33, Gal. vi. 7. ‘Here its earnestness is
softvned by the addition ἀδελφοί as in Ignat. Philad. 3, Eph. 16.

17, πᾶσα δόσις ἀγαθὴ καὶ πᾶν δώρημα τέλειοι] ‘All good giving and
every perfect gift’ (descend from Him who gives to all liberally).
The sti-ess is laid on ἀγαθή and τέλειον. Beyschlag and Erdmann
with others have assigned to πᾶσα the same meaning as it bore
in v. 2, but this use is rarely found except in reference to abstract
qualities, not to acts or things No doubt such a rendering would
