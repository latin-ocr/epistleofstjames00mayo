ccii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

words, cf. μαρανθήσεται, πειράζομαι above, δελεαζόμενος 1. 14,
ἀποσκίασμα i. 17, μάταιος ἡ θρησκεία i. 26, ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀὙα-
πῶσιν αὐτόν (whcrc obscrvc thc allitcration in 5] and p) ii. 5, μεστὴ
ἰοῦ θανατηφόρου iii. 8, ἐπίγειος, ψυχική, δαιμονιώδης iii. 15, ἀφαυ-
ιζομένη iv. 14, Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ εἰσελήλυθαν v. 4.

Ι St. James employs this strong weighty rhythm in poetical and
Ἰ prophetical passages, such as we find chictly in the lst and 3rd
, chaptcrs ancl the beginning of ch. v. In argumentative or col-
’ loquial passages, such as we find in chapters ii. and iv. and the
latter part of chapter v., the rhythm employed is very different,
generally plain and unlaboured‚ and often crisp‚ sharp, abrupt,
running much into interrogations, as in ii. 14· τί ὄφελος ἀδελφοί
μου ἐὰν πίστιν λε”γῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃς μὴ δύναται ἡ
πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν,· V. 13 κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν ; προσευχέσθω·
εὐθυμεῖ τις ; ψαλλέτω.

If we arc asked to character-ize in a few words the more general
qualities of St. James' style, as they irnpress themselves on the
¹att entivo reader‚ perhaps these would be best summed up in the
3ter1ns,ene1gy‚ vivacity, and, as conducive to both, vividness os
K representatioffly the last I mean that dislike of mere abstrac-
4 tioiis, that delight in thlowing evcrything into picturesque and
dramatic fmms, t>Which 13 so marked a feature in our Epistle. This
is seen partly in the use of metaphorica]expressions of which I
have spoken above. Thus the thought of an undecided character
calls up the image of some light object tossing on the surface of the
wave ; the development of sin in the heart and life takes the form
of the birth and growth of a living creature; the conviction pro-
duced by the Word is figured by the reflexion of the face in the
mirror and so on. And often the figure becomes more realistic by
the way in which it is introduced, as an actual narrative of a past
event: so in i. 11 of the withering of the flower, in i. 24 of the
man looking into the mirsor, ² he beheld himself, and is gone, and
straightway forgot wffiianner os man he was.' In like manner,
abstract qualitics are exhibited in concrete shape. Is it respect
of pc1·s‹›ns‚oi an umeal profession of phil intlnopy which calls for
iebuke 2 St. James at once dr imatlses the scene; particularizing
the place—the synagogue3 the personsssffe rich with 1113 fine
clothes and gold ring, the poor in his shabby attir;c the opposite
treatment oso the two-the fawning on thc rich σὺ κάθου ὦδε
