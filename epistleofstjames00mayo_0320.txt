the symbol of purity), ib. vii. 14, xix. 8, Isa. lxi. 10, dxc. The metaphor
is continued in the word ῥυπαρία (ἅπ. λεγ. in N.T.): see below ii. 3, Isa.
lxiv. 6 ‘our righteousness is as filthy rags,’ Zeeh. iii. 4 ἀφέλετε τὰ
ἱμάτια τὰ ῥυπαρὰ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἷπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἰδού ἀφῄρηκα τὰς ἀνομίας
σου, καὶ ἐνδύσατε αὐτὸν ποδήρη, Job xiv. 4, Apoc. xxii. 11 ὁ ῥυπαρὸς
ῥυπανθήτω. St. Paul uses the synonym μολυσμός 2 Cor. vii. 1 (filthi-
ness of the flesh and spirit). Strictly speaking the word ῥύπος is used
of the wax of the ear, as in Hippocrates and Clem. Al. I’aed. ii. p. 222
P. quoted by Heisen‚ who suggests that there may be an allusion to
the purged ear, auriam removendae sordes sunt quae audiendi celeritatem
'impedire quemn ,· but it cannot be assumed without evidence that the
derivative retained the original force of the simple word. The phrase
σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου is used of baptism in 1 Pet. iii. 21 3 and so Schegg
would explain here ; but there is no reference here to a past event.
The aorist participle is part and parcel of the command contained in
the imperative δέξασθε, as in the quotations from St. Paul. Other
examples of the metaphorical use are Philo M. 1. p. 597 (through
repentance the soul washes away) τὰ καταῤῥυπαίνοντα, ib. 585, 273,
Dion. Hal. Ast. xi. 5 ῥυπαίνοντες αἰσχρῷ βίῳ τὰς ἑαυτῶν τε καὶ τῶν
προγόνων ἀρετάς, Epict. Dies. 2. 5 recommends the expulsion of a
ῥυπαρὰ φαντασία by one Which iS καλὴ καὶ γενναία, Luc. V. Auel. 3 καθαρὰν
τὴν ψυχὴν ἐργασάμενος καὶ τὸν ἐπ’ αὐτῇ ῥύπον ἐκκλύσας, Acta Thomae.
Tisch. p. 200 ῥυπαρὰ κοινωνία, ῥυπαρὰ ἐπιθυμία, Ignat. Eph. 16 ἐάν τις
πίστιν θεοῦ ἐν κακῇ διδασκαλίᾳ φθείρῃ...ῥυπαρὸς γινόμενος εἷς τὸ πῦρ τὸ
ἄσβεστον χωρήσει. Plutarch uses ῥυπαρία (like our ‘Shabbiness’) Of
avarice (Mor. p. 60 D): the compounds ῥυπαρόψυχος, ῥυπαρογνώμων are
found in Byzantine writers, Its precise force in our text will be con-
sidered in the following note.

περισσείαν κακίας.] ‘ Overflowing (ebullition) of malice.' The meaning
is best shown in the cognate phrase in Luke vi. 45 (‘ the evil man out
of the evil treasure in his heart bringeth forth that which is evil ') ἐκ
γὰρ τοῦ περισσεύματος τῆς καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ. The only other
passages in which περισσεία occurs in N.T. are Rom. v, 17 τὴν περισσείαν
τῆς χάριτος ‘the superabundance of grace,' 2 Cor. viii. 2 ἡ περισσεία τῆς
χαρᾶς...ε’περίσσεῑ·σεν εἶς τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς ἁπλότητος αὐτῶν ‘ the overflowing
of their joy overflowed to (so as to make up) the wealth of their
generosity‚' 2 Cor. x. 15 εἷς περισσείαν ‘ to overflowing ' (abundantly).
The writer warns his readers against hasty and passionate words,
against the outbreak of evil temper. Then comes the question whether
ῥυπαρίαν is to be taken separately (Calvin, Bouman, Lange), or as
governing κακίας along with περισσείαν. The fact that πᾶσαν is not
repeated is in favour of the latter construction, which is supported by
Matthaei's Schol. τὴν ἁμαρτίαν τὴν ῥυπαίνουσαν τὸν ἄνθρωπον φησί, τὴν ὡς
περιττὴν οὖσαν ε’ν ἡμῖν. Perhaps however ib is better to give καί an
epexegetic force, ‘all defilement and efl'ervescence of malice’ being
equivalent to ‘ all detilement caused by the overflowing malice of the
heart’: so XViesinger ‘allen Schmutz der reichlich bei ihnen sich
tiudcndeu I3osheit.’ Other explanations of περισσεία are (1) ⁴ superfluity '
A.V. (malitiam majorem quam in Christianis expectaveris, Theile).
