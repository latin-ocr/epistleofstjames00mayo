xx THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

tive: and he cites the following as instances in his favour. ‘When
God said to Jacob “ Ι will not leave thee until I have done that
which I have spoken to thee of'’ (Gen. xxviii. 15), it followeth not
that, when that was done, the God of Jacob left him. When the
conclusion of Deuteronomy was written it was said of Moses “No
man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day '' (Dent. xxxiv. (5), but
it were a weak argument to infer from thence, that the sepulchre
of Moses has been known ever since. When Samuel had delivered
a severe prediction unto Saul, he “ came no more to see him unto
the day of his death ’' (1 Sam. xv. 35); but it were a strange
collection to infer, that he therefore gave him a visit after he was
dead. “ Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unte the day of
her death (2 Sam. vi.- 2:3); and yet it were a ridiculous stupidity to
dream of any mid wifery in the grave, Christ promised his presence
to the Apostles “until the end of the world’' (Matt. xxviii. 20);
who ever made so unhappy a construction, as to infer from thence
that for ever after he would be absent from them ἲ ’ (Ormi, p. 174).

death,’ ‘ to the end of the world: this is only a more vivid way of say-
ing in saecula saeculorum. In like manner the phrase ‘ unto this day '
implies that a certain state of things continued up to the very last
moment known to the writer: the suggestion is of course that it
will still continue. The remaining instance is that contained in
Gen. xxviii. 15. This is a promise of continued help on the part
of God until a certain end is secui-ed. NVhen that end is secured
God is no further bound by his promise, however much the
patriarch might be justified in looking for further help from his
general knowledge of the character and goodness of God. To take -
now a case similar to that in hand : supposing we read ‘Michal had
no child till she left David and became the wife of PhaltieL’ we
should naturally assumo that after that she did have a child. So
