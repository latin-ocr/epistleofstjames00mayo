enough to name a man whom he considers capable of having
written even the least of these works. Would it be at all a wilder
hypothesis if one were to assume that half the plays of Shakspeare

How are we to account for such extraordinary aberration '120 01rns

on the part of able and honest men 2 It seems to me that 1333?-
it is due partly to prejudice and partly to an error of method.
First, as to prejudice: they start with two assumptions, (1) that
the presumption is always against the truth of tradition,
(2) that miracles are impossible. The former prejudice is a
natural reaction from the opposite extreme, that tradition is always
right, and it falls in with the natural delight in novelty, and the
temptation to take the side which affords most scope for new and
startling combinations. There is also a natural impatience at the
tone of virtuous orthodoxy often assumed by the defenders of tradi-
tion, and a generous eagerness to take the side which has suffered
most from misrepresentation in the past, and which still finds it
necessary at times to resist attempts on the part of the champions
of authority to intimidate opponents and stifle discussion, a feeling
too that, in order to the final ascertainment of truth, the negative
argument is as needful as the positive, and that up to the present
century the former has scarcely had justice done to it among
Christian writers. The second prejudice naturally leads to the
attempt to weaken the force of the evidence adduced in favour of
miracles. If the accounts of miracles proceed from eye-witnesses, it
is difficult, on this hypothesis, not to condemn them of deliberate
falsehood, which our opponents are unwilling to do, not simply
because they do not wish to give unnecessary offence‚ but because
they are themselves convinced of the honesty and high tone of the
writers. If, however, it can be proved that these writers lived a

hundred years after the events they record, then they are simply
the mouthpiece of tradition, which, without any deliberate falsifica-
tion, would spontaneously clothe the bare nucleus of fact with the
garment of the supernatural.

Next, as to the error of method. Men assume α priori
that the Christian Ohurch and Christian theology must have
had such and such a development3 that if we find one doctrino
especially prominent in a particular writer, he inust have been
