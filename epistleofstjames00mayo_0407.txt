V 4—5 NOTES - 147

ἀποστῇ ἕως ἐπισκέψηται ὁ ὕψιστος καὶ...ποιήσει κρίσιν. For the oppression
of the hireling cf. Job. vii. 2, ib. xxiv. 6-12, Sirac. xxxiv. 26.

αἱ βοαί] Only here in N.T., cf. Exod. ii. 23 ἀνέβη ἡ βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς
τὸν Θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων, 1 Sam. ix. 16 ἐτι-ἔβλεψα ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῖ-
λαοῦ μου, ὅτι ἦλθε βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς μέ.

εἰς τὰ. ὦτα. Κυρίου Σαβαώθ.] From Isa. v. 9 ἠκούσθη γὰρ εἷς τὰ ὦτα
Κυρίου Σαβαώθ. The on] y other passage in N.T. where the form occurs
is Rom. ix. 29, a quotation from Isa. i. 9. In the LXX. it is found in
1 Sam. i. 3, 11 Ἀὃωναῒ Κύριε Ἐλωὶ Σαβαώθ, ib. XV. 2, and in Isa. ii.
12, vi. 3 &a : more often it is translated either by παντοκράτωρ, as in
2 Sam. v, 10, Apoc. iv. 8 compared with Isa. vi. 3, and in Jeremiah
and the 11111101· ProphetS, esp. Malachi3 or by δυνάμεων, as in Ps. lix. 5,
lxxx. 7, &Q Hermas Vis. i. 3 : sometimes it is omitted, as frequently in
J eremiah. By later writers it is used as an independent name of (1οᾶ
in the nom. 01· voc. sing. as in Act. Apoc. Τ. p. 86, Sibyll. i. 316 ὁ μέγας
Σαβαώθ. Its immediate reference is to the hosts of heaven, whether
angels or the stars over which they preside, then it is used more
generally to express the Divine Omnipotence‚ cf. Matt. xxvii. 53, Luke
vii. 7, 2 Kings vi. 17, Josh. V. 14. See Cheyne's Isaiah, app. on I. 9.
The use of this name is 0110 among many indications serving to show
that the epistle is addressed to Jews.

εἰσελήλυθαν,] 111 later Greek the regular forms of the imperf„ 2nd
aon, and perf. were often changed to the type of the lst aor„ as εἶδαν,
ἔπεσαν, ἐλάβοσαν, εὖροσαν, εἴχοσαν, Cf. Winer, pp. 86—91, and for examples
Of the perf. John xvii. 7 ἔγνωκαν, ib. xvii. 6 τετήρηκαν, Luke ix. 36
ἑώρακαν, Rom. xvi. 7 γέγοναν, Barnabas vii. 3 πεφανέρωκαν. Meister-
hans (Gr. Ait. Inscr. p. 147) cites παρείληφαν from Smyrna 230 B.('.,
ὃιατετέλεκαν, ἐντέτευχαν, εἵσχηκαν, πεποίηκαν, all B.C. from Laconia.
5. ἐτρυφήσατε] Only here in N.T. The noun occurs 2 Pet. ii. 13
ἡδονὴν ἡγούμενοι τὴν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τρυφήν, Luke vii. 25. It is used in blame
here, as generally in classical authors: in good sense in Isa. lxvi. 11
ἵνα ἐκθηλάσαντες τρυφήσητε ἀπὸ εἷσόὸου δόξης αὐτῆς and Neh. ix. 25.
Hermas joins it with σπαταλάω in Sim. 6. 1, no doubt a reminiscence of
this paS=·age, τὰ πρόβατα ὡσεὶ τρυφῶντα ἦν καὶ λίαν σπαταλῶντα, Which is
interpreted of those who have given themselves up to the lusts of the
world and are afterwards delivered over to the angel of vengeance.

ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς] 111 contrast to the judgment in heaven of the Lord of
Sabaoth, cf. Matt. vi. 19 μὴ θησαυρίζετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.

ἐσπαταλήσατε] Found elsewhere in N.T. only in 1 Tim. v. 6 ἡ δὲ
σπαταλῶσα ζῶσα τέθνηκεν. It occurs also in Ezek. XVi. 49 ἐσπατάλων
αὕτη καὶ αἶ θυγατέρες, Sir. xxi. 15 ἤκουσεν ὃ σπαταλῶν, Earn. Χ. 3 ὅταν
σπαταλῶσιν λανθάνονται τοῦ Κυρίου, but iS much l‘arer than τρυφάω, and
is never found in a good sense. The noun occurs Sir. xxvii. 13 γέλως
αὐτῶν ἐν σπατάλῃ ἁμαρτίας, and Varro ap. Non. p. 46. 12 spatvle
ecio-avit omnes Venerivafsa pueros ,· the compound verb κατασπαταλάω
Prov. xxix. 21, Amos vi. 4. The Classical word of the same root,
σπαθάω (fr. σπάθη, the hatten, used in weaving for the purpose of driving
home the threads of the woof), occurs in Dem. RL. p. 354, where
Shilleto says that the only example of the literal sense is the play on
