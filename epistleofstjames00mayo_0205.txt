ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GRAMMAR OF sT. JAMES clxxxi

ἅ ν (sce above under subjunctive and compound sentences) is not
used by our author with the past indicative, though this is common
enough in other books of the N.T. eg. Heb. xi. 2, 9, Gal. iv. 15,
Matt. xi. 21, or with the optative, a construction which is found
only in Luke and Acts. It is omitted with ὅστις before a sub-
junctive in ii. 10, and likewise with ἕως in v. 7. The former
construction is very rare in the N.T. but is found occasionally in
classical Greek, both verse and prose ; the latter is not uncommon
in the N.T. and is found in Classical poetry and in Aristotle.
Instead of ἄν we find ἐάν used with the relative in classical Greek
as well as in the N.T., see note on ὃς ἐάν iv. 4.

ἐ ν τ ε ὕ θ ε ν, pleonastic use before ἐκ τῶν ἡδονῶν iV. 1.

ἔ π ε ι τ a used, as in classica] authors, after πρῶτον μέν without
an accompanying δέ in iii. 17.

‘672- ο υ, used for ἕπῃ or ὅποι iii. 4.

ο ὕ τ ω ς, generally used with reference to a preceding com—
pariso'n, as in i. 11, ii. 17, but in ii. 12 explained by what follows,
οὕτως λαλεῖτε ὡς μέλλοντες κρίνεσθαι, seemingly pleonastie in
iii. 10, where see note.

ὦ δ ε is used, as in the N.T. generally and in Theocritus and the
post-classical writers, of place,1 for the classica] ἐνταῦθα or ἐνθάδε, of
which the former is not found in the N .T. and the latter only in
Luke (including Acts) and John.

ἥ interrogative, z Latin cm, implying a negative answer, iv. 5.

¹ It is denied by most grammarians following Aristarchus that the local sense is
found in Homer and the earlier authors, but in many passages its use seems to
approach very near to that of our ⁶ hither,' eg. Il. xviii. 392 ’Ἥφαιστε πρόμολ’ ὧδε,
Soph. 0. T. 7 ὧδ’ ἐλήλυθα, and other passages quoted in Ellendt’s Lex„ Plato P-Joc.
328 ὧδε ἀφικέσθαι.
