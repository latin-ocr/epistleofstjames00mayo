perfection of which they had all along been dimly conscions, and
reunolnber how its sorrows had been increased by the laek of

the kingdom of God shall come 1’ How natural, also, that one of
the earliest appearances of the Risen Lord should have been made
to his repentant brother, and that that brother should from that
day forth have united himself to the company of the Apostles,
and been chosen by them to preside over the church in Jerusalem,
while they proceeded to carry out their Master's last charge, to
preach the Gospel to every nation 11 ‘ ⁸
