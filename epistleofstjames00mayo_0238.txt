ccxii THE EPISTLE OF ST. J AMES

iii. 4 ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστου πηδαλίου, α ligno easifflco.

iii. 5 ἰδού, ctiam.

iii. 6 καὶ ἡ «γλῶσσα πῦρ, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ «γλῶσσα
καθίσταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν, ἡ σπιλοῦσα ὅλον τὸ σῶμα καὶ
φλογίζουσα τὸν τροχὸν τῆς Γγενέσεως, καὶ φλοὙιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς
«γεέννης, et linqua ‘tynis est, et oriundus peccati veluti silva est, et ipsa
linqua, eum sit inter membra nostra, maculat totum corpus nostrum
cc incendit series generationum nostrarum qucw currunt veluti rotae,
ac incenditur ipsa ique} [On the interpolation veluti 3ἱίιά Ι have
said something in my note. The interpretation of the phrase
φλογίζουσα.. ,τῆς ’γενέσεως seems to be an explanatory paraphrase,
like that in i. 25.]

iii. 17 ἀνυπόκριτος, vultum 'non aecipitss

iv. 9 ταλαιπωρήσατε καὶ πενθήσατε καὶ κλαύσατε, hmniliate vos
et luyete.

iv. 16 πᾶσα καύχησις τοιαύτη πονηρά ἐστιν, omnis qloriatio
quite est <jus modi α malo est.

v. 2 σέσηπεν, corrupta s‘zmt et secuerunt.

v. 6 οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται, et non restitit.

In these variations I do not see that there is anything to sug-
gest that the Peshitto represents more truly than the Greek the
thought of the original author. On the contrary we find that the
force of the Greek is often lost or blurred by the disappearance of
a metaphor‚ as in i. 14, i. 26, iii. 2, or by the substitution of a
weaker for a more vigorous phrase, as in i. 6, i. 17, i. 21, ii. 8, iii. 6,
ν. 6. The variations of the Corbey Latin seem to me to belong
generally to the same category3 and to be due either to want of
ability or want of conscientiousness on the part of the translator.
Where they appear to be confirmed by the variations of the PeshittO,
it is possible, as Prof. Rendel Harris'has shown in his brilliant
study on the Codex Bezae, that the Latin was directly influenced
by the Syriae, ‘The Syriasms found in the Latin text of several
ancient MSS. exceed in harshness the Syriasms of the Greek text.’
He considers that the Latin text of the Codex Bezae dates from

the second century and arranges its constituents (prior to the end
of that century) in the following crder:

¹ ‘The relative quac hore rosor-s to .s·m·2'e.<.·.’—G. H. G.
² ‘ This is the regular syriae rendering of ὑποκριτής and its eognates.’—G. ΙΙ. G.
