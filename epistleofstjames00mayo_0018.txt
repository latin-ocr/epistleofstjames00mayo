Since the notes were printed, Bernhard Weiss has brought out his Text-
kritische Untersuclzunyen und Tea-tlmrstclluny of the Catholic Epistles, containing
a careful investigation of the characteristics of the two groups of uncial MSS„
Sin.ABC representing the older text, and KLP representing the later text.
As he follows WH. in assigning the greatest authority to Β, his own text is
generally in agreement with theirs. Ι notice below all the instances in which
his reading differs from theirs and from mine. The exegetical notes are not of
much importance. As regards orthography he writes ἀλαζονεία, κακοπαθεία,
ἐριθεία, Ἠλίας, where I have adopted Hort’s spelling (see p. cliii of my Intro-
duction). For ἀποκυεῖ he reads ἀποκῦει, for θρησκός, θρῆσκος.

Ι. a—He takes ἀνὴρ δίψυχος 111 apposition to ἅνθρωπος, as I have done;
not (with WH.) as subject of λήμψεται.

b Ι. 9.—He reads ὁ (omitted by B) before ἀδελφός. Ι have followed WH. in
raeketino it.

Ι. 10.—⁰He follows Huther and Beyschlag in under-standing πλούσιος of an
unbeliever and giving an ironical force to καυχάσθω.

Ι. 17.—He takes ἄνωθέν ἐστιν καταβαῖνον together3 and interprets τροπῆς
ἀποσκίασμα 111 the same way as Beyschlag ‘eine durch eine Wendung der
Himmelslichter hervorgebrachte Beschattung.'

I. 2l.—He puts a Comma after ἐν πραΰτητι, taking it With ἀποθέμενοι.

Lea—He translates τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως ‘das Angesicht womit einer

eboren ist.’
g Ι. 25.—He translates ἐν τῇ ποιήσει ‘auf Grund seines Thuns‚' referring to

Ι· 191. l.—He takes ἔχετε as imperative, not (with WH.) as indicative asking a
,question In! the same verse lie makes τῆς δόξης genitive of quality after
[affugrffffgssplains συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν as a J ewish synagogue frequented by the

s.
011ΙΓΙΙ,εἰῖιὶῑ-Π-πτωχοὺς τῶ κόσμω. Weiss translates ‘in Bezug auf weltliche Giiter,

and says that the Dative ‘steht zur Bezeichnung der Sphare! In the sanie
verse he translates ἐν πίστει ‘ auf Grund Glaubens.

ΙΙ. 14 and 16.—He reads τί τὸ ὄφελος, against B and WH.

ΙΙ. 18.-*Taking ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις as an objection made by a bystander to what
had just been said, he understands σύ of the professing believer censured by
St. J ames. Surely it is incredible that any writer could have stated an ob-
jection in so awkward 3 form.

ΙΙ. 19. He reads εἷς ὁ Θεός ἐστιν with C and WH.¹1¹ ; εἷς Θεός ἐστιν is the read-
ing of B and WH. ; I read εἷς ἐστὶν ὁ Θεός with Sin. Ti. Treg. NVeiss weakens
the force Of καὶτὰ δαιμόνια πιστεύουσιν καὶ φρίσσουσιν by making it parenthetical.

111. 3.—He reads εἶ δέ, though he fails, like every one else, to find a natural
apodosis, and acknowledges (p. 66) that the reading ει δε γαρ 111 Sin. proves
that ἰ’δε was intended.

ΙΙΙ. 6.-τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως. He explains ‘human lise, whose restless
inovement spreads in all directions the once kindled flames

III. 16,—He translates ἐριθεία by ‘ Rechthaberei. der es nicht auf die Sache
ankommt‚ sondern auf das Verfechten der eigenen Meinung‚' aud opposes it to
εὐπειθής. ⁴ A pertinacious argumentative disposition ' is a meaning which
