ΟΝ THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMEs clvii

assertion made about the noun is not more true os one member
of the class than of another. This is naturally expressed by the
English indefinite article in such passages as i. 6 ἔοικεν κλύδωνι,
where the comparison is to a wave generally, not to any particular
wave3 so in iii. 12 μὴ δύναται συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι; and ii. 18
ἐὰν ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἀδελφὴ «γυμνοὶ ὑπάρχωσιν, 11. 24⁴ ἐξ ἕρτγων δικαιοῦται
ἄνθρωπος, i. 23 ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ.

When the class as a whole is spoken of, the article is used either
with the collective noun, as ἡ ἐκκλησία v. 143 or with the plural of
the persons or things composing the class, as οἱ πλούσιοι 11. 6, τῶν
ἵππων 111. 3, τοὺς ἀνθρώπους 111. 9; 01 with one such person 01
thing, considered as typical or representative of the class (the
‘generic' article), eff. ὁ πλούσιος i. 12, ἡ πηγή iii. 11, ὁ «γεωρτγός
v. 7. If the article is omitted, the plural denotes that some of the
class are concerned in the assertion, without saying anything as to
the rest of the class, as κᾶν ἁμαρτίας ᾗ πεποιηκώς v, 15, πλῆθος
ἁμαρτιῶν v. 20, ἐξ ἕρνγων δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος ii. 24, ἕλκουσιν
ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια ii. 6.

If two or 111016 nouns denoting different persons or things are
joined by καί, 1116 3111016 15 regularly repeated with each, 35 111 iii.
11 τὸ «γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ πικρόν; but if the nouns taken together
are regarded as denoting or constituting one person or thing, the
article is only used with the first, as in iii. 9 εὐλοτγοῦμεν τὸν Θεὸν
καὶ Πατέρα.

One case in which the Greek use of the article agrees with
French and German in opposition to the English is that of
abstractions such as ἡ δόξα, ἡ πίστις, which are thus, as it were,
personified and looked at as something existing apart from the
person or action with which they are concerned, cf. ii. 17 ἡ πίστις,
ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα, νεκρά ἐστιν, 11. 20, 22 ἡ πίστις συνήρτγει τοῖς
ἔρνγοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἔρτγων ἡ πίστις ἐτελειώθη, where
R. V. has ‘Faith wrought with his works and by works was
saith made perfect.' In the oblique cases the article 15 generally
omitted unless (as in i. 2 τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως, 11. 1 τὴν
πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν) 1116 noun is defined by the context.
Thus we have ii. 14. ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν and i. 6 αἰτείτω ἐν
πίστει, because it 15 1101 faith absolute, saith as a sels—existent
idea, which is spoken of, but merely saith relative, a quality
attributed to an act or an individual. So ii. :24 ἐξ ἔργων
