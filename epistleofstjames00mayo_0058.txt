xxxiv THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

coming of the Messiah, the prophet like unte Moses who would
speak the words of God to the people, the Prince of the house of
David, who would not merely judge the heathen and restore again
the glories of Solonion, but would sit as a refiner and purifier of
silver and purify the sons of Levi themselves, and yet one who
would bear the sius of many and make intercession for the trans-
gressorS.¹ To both it is revealed that the Messiah should be born
of Mary by a miraculous conception. Joseph is told that ‘his name
is 10 be called Jesus, because he shall save his people from their
sins.' Mary is told in addition that ‘ he shall be called the Son of
the Highest, and that the Lord God shall give him the throne of
his father David, aud he shall reign over the house of Jacob for
.ever.' There is surely nothing in these words which would disclose
What the Christian mystery ⁸ God manifest in the flesh.' They point 10 a

affligor praise is founded on the recollection of Hannah's exultation at the

111-11131ιά fulfilment of prophecy in the birth os her son. Her mind would
³⁰⁵ep¹¹' naturally turn to other miraculous births, to that of Isaac under
the old dispensation, to that now impending in the case of her
cousin Elizabeth. And as there was nothing in the announcement
made to them which could enable them 10 realize the astonnding

tion of examples would be superfluous, and Ι shall content myself with referring to
Pesaelmssnt, 113 α, b, as fairly illustrating the doctrine of orthodox Judaism on this
point' 3 ib. pp. 168, 9, ‘ The early disciples in the mother Church of Jerusalem show
l'hirisaie but not Essene sympathies. It was altogether within the sphere of ortho-
dox .Jud.-iism that the Jewish clement in the Christian brotherhood found its
scope.⁷ Cf. also C. Taylor‚ Lucem-as on tlte Dt'daclw, pp. 86-88.

² See ltyle and ι11111105, Psalmis of Solonion, p. lii. (speaking of the 17th Psalm):
‘It may be taken, we believe, as prosenting, more aecurately than any other
document, a statement of the popular Pharasaic expectation regarding the Messiah,
shortly before the time when our Lord JesuS‚ the Christ, appeared.' Among the
characteristics of the Messiah's rule there given, it is stated that ‘He is to be a
descendant of David‚' that His Mission is of a twosold character, destructive
towards Gentiles and sinners, restorative as regards Israel: His rule is spiritual,
hely, wise, and just: ‘all his snbjects will be sons of God, all will be hol‘y,' cf.
l‘s. xvii. :35 καὶ αὐτὸς βασιλεὺς δίκαιος καὶ διδακτὸς ὑπὸ Θεοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτούς· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἀδικία ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, ὅτι πάντες ἅγιοι καὶ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν
Χριστὸς Κύριος (sd. Κύριον). But (p. lv.) ‘ though endowed with divine gifts, he is
nothing more thau man. Neitherofsu1)·=1·11atui·al birth, noros pre-existence in the
bosom of God, or among the angels of God, do we find any trace.’ He is an
idealized solomon. Again (p. lxii.) they remark, ‘it is a matter not without interest
and importance that nur Psalms, which stand clos-est of all extant Jewish religione
poetry to the Christian era, are 50 0011511101101151)7 similar to the songs contained iu
the opening chapters of St. Luke’s GospeL’ Τ110 editors appear even to suggest the
possibility that the so-called Psalms of Solomon may have been written by the
author of the Neont- dimin& (p. lix. n.). In ιῘιι»·1;111’5 dialogue (ἓ 49) Trypho assei-ts
