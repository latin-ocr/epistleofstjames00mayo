111 this and the following verses their προσωπολημψία is condemned
(1) as impiety, contravening 'che purpose of God, who has selected
the poor as special objects of His love3 (2) as injusbice and want of
common sense, since ib was the rich who oppressed bliem.

6. ἠτιμάσατε.] In the case supposed you slighted him by Julbting him
into an inferior position, cf. Prov. xiV. 21 ὁ ἀτιμάζων πένητας ἁμαρτάνει, ¹ ’
ἐλεῶν δὲ πτωχοὺς μακαριστός, ib. xxii. 22, Sir. X. 22 οὗ δίκαιον ἀτιμάσαι {2¹
πτωχὸν συνετὸν καὶ οὗ καθήκει δοξάσαι ἄνδρα ἁμαρτωλόν, the word 13 also ¹
used Luke xx. 11, Acts V. 41. For a similar instance of unfair dis-
tinctions among Ohristians see 1 Cor. xi. 22. Se. Peter in his lsb epistile
ii. 17 lays down the rule πάντας τιμήσατε.

οἱ πλούσιοι. καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν.] In the supposed case the sole
ground of preference between the two strangers was thais the oue
seemed rich, the obher pom-3 but] you have certainly no reason for
favouring the rich as a class. The vei-b only occurs elsewhere in Acts
Χ. 38 in NT. but we find the similar forms κατακυριεύειν and κατεξου-
σιάζειν Mam. XX. 25. 1ss is nob uncommon in LXX. wissh acc„ cf. Micah ἢ

αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια ;] ‘With their own hands drag you t
the tribunals! The pronoun αὐτὸς 13 used in the nominative, not onl
with the meaning ‘self ' when attached to a subjecb, as in elassical
Greek, bub also when itself standing for the subject, with a less amount
of emphasis, which we might render ‘he for 1113 Ρα1·1;’ or ‘ib was he
wh0‚⁷ as in the nexb clause 3 11] 13 disputed whether it does nob in some .-
cases lose its emphatic force albogether‚ as in Luke xix. 2 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ f -
ὀνόματι καλούμενος Ζακχαῖος, καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ἀρχιτελώνης καὶ αὐτὸς πλούσιος.

καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, see XVffler, p.
186 foll.; A. Buttmann, p. 93 foll. 1 have 1101] noticed the fem. and Ρ
nent. used in this laxer significabion. Sta. Paul condemns Christians for
going to law with one another (l Cor. vi. where see Wetst.): here St.
James is speaking of the persecucion of Christians by Jews, especially by
the rich Sadducees, cf. Acts iv. 1, xiii. 50. Paul and Silas were dragged
before the judgmenb-seab (called κριτήριον 1 Gor. vi. 2, 4, Exod. xxi.
6, Dan. vii. 9, Polyb. ix. 33: the classical word 13 δικαστήριον) ab
Philippi, ἐπιλαβόμενοι εἵλκυσαν εἷς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας (Acts xvi.
19) 5 and of Saul before his conversion we read σύρων ἄνδρας καὶ γυναῖ-
κας παρεδίδου εἷς φυλακήν. Oui· Lord foretolcl that his diseiples would
be cited before the law courbs both of Jews and Gentiles (Ma‘ob. x. 7,
18), 1)6 expelled from ‘ohe synagogues and pub 150 death (John xvi. 2).

7. οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασφημοῦσιν τὸ καλὸν ὅνομα.] ‘IS ib nob they Who
blaspheme the noble name'c' Βλάσφημος and its cognates are used
generally of slander and evil-speaking, as in 2 Pet. ii. 11, Tit. iii. 2,
Col. iii. 8: in the N.T. they have also the special meaning of impie‘cy
towards God and Christ, (= λέγει ἀνάθεμα Ἰησοῦν); 30 Su. Paul Acts
