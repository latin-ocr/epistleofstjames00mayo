Beyschlag, Erdniann, Schegg‚ and the great majority of modern com-
mentators. We may allow that St. James makes frequent use of the
genitive of quality, as in i. 25 ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς, ii. 4 κριταὶ διαλογισ<
μῶν πονηρῶν, dvc. : but it is very improbable thail such a genitive would
be appended to a phrase which is already complete in itself, and we
may safely say that 110 0110 would have thought of such a construction
for this passage if the other suggested interpretations had not involved
equal or even greater harshness.

There is however a perfectly natural and easy construction sug<
gested by Bengel, which has been set aside by later commentator-s
on what seem to me very inadequate grounds. His note 15, ίτῆς

aequal, nemo personarum acceptor (canosa-its] The objecti‹.·n made
to it is that the abstract terni δόξα, by itself, is too indefinite
to bear this weight of meaning. But other abstractions are used
of Christ. He calls himself the Truth, the Life, He is called the
Word, why not the Glory? If we had before us such a sentence as· μὴ
ἔχετε ἐν ἀφροσύνῃ τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, τοῦ λόγου,
we should have no scruple in trz‘inslating it ‘ Do not hold in folly the
faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Word,' any more than ue
have in translating 1 Tim. i. 1 κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Κυρίου Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τῆς
ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν, ‘According to the command of Christ Jesus, who is our
hope.’ Why should we object to the similar translation here, ‘the
faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the glory ’2 The only question
is whether the abstract δόξα 15 thus used of a person. Bengel cites
Luke ii. 31 τὸ σωτήριον ὃ ἡτοίμασας...δόξαν λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, Eph. i. l?
ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὁ Πατὴρ τῆς δόξης, 1 Pet. iv. 14-
εἰ ὀνειδίζεσθε ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ, μακάριοι, ὅτι τὸ τῆς δόξης καὶ τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ
Πνεῦμα ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀναπαύεται (where he takes δόξης asan appellationes
Christ). Perhaps more striking parallels are 2 Pet. i. 17 φωνῆς ἐνεχθεί-
σης τοιᾶσδε ὑπὸ τῆς μεγαλοπρεποῦς δόξης (‘ The words seem a periphrasis
for (1οᾶ Himself,' Alfi), Col. i. 27 τί τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου
τούτου, ὅ ἐστιν Χριστὸς ἐν ἡμῖν, ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης, Rom. ix. 4, where it
stands for the Shekinah (cf. 1 Sam. iv, 22, Psa. lxxviii. 61, ib. cvi. 20,
Isa. iv. 5), John xvii. 22 ἐγὼ τὴν δόξαν ἢν δέδωκάς μοι δέδωκα αὐτοῖς, N).
i. 14 ἐθεασάμεθα τὴν δόξαν ἀυτοῦ, δόξαν ὡς μονογενοῦς παρὰ Πατρός (of
which Westcott says (p. xlvii.) ‘oin-ist the Light of the world is seen
by the believer to be the manifested Glory of God '), Heb. i. 3 ἀπαύγασμα
δόξης. Similarly μεγαλωσύνη 15 used Heb. i. 3, and δύναμις Mati. xxvi.
64, cf. Clem. Rom. i. 16 τὸ σκῆπτρον τῆς μεγαλωσύνης τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὁ Κύριος
ἡμῶν Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς. We may suppose that the reason why the word
δόξα stands here alone, without ἡμῶν or τοῦ Πατρός, 15 111 order that it
may be understood in its fullest and widest sense of Hiin who alone
comprises all glory in Himself. This interpretation is confirmed by the
rhythm which makes a natural pause before τῆς δόξης,
