176 COMMENT

(Part I. ch. 4): ‘It must be somewhat either in our externa] circum-
stances· or in our nature. For on the one hand persons may be betrayed
into wrong behaviour upon surprise, or overcome upon any other
very singular and extraordinary external occasions, who would other- ¹
wis-e have preserved their character of prudence and of virtue ε in which
cases every one, in speaking of the wrong behaviour of these persons,
would imputo it to such external circumstances. And 011 the other
hand men who have contracted habits of vice and folly of any kind, or
have some particular passions in excess, will seek opportunities, and, as
it were, go out of their way to gratify themselves in these respects at
the expense of their wisdom and their virtue 3 led to it, as every one
would say, not by externa] temptations, but by such habits and
passions. . . . However, ας, when we say, men are misled by external
circumstances of temptation, it cannot but be understood, that there is
somewhat within themselves to render those circumstances temptations,
or to render them susceptible of impressions from them; so, when we
say, they are misled by passions, it is always supposed that there are
occasions, circumstances, and objects exciting these passions, and afford-
ing means for gratifying them. And therefore temptations from within
and from without coincide and mutually imply each other.'

Again, speaking of moral improvement by discipline, he says (ch. 5) :
‘ Mankind and perhaps all finite creatures from the very constitution
of their nature, before habits of virtue, are deficient and in danger of
deviating from what is right, and therefore stand in need of virtuous
habits for a security against this danger. For, together with the
general principle of moral understanding, we have in our inward frame
various affections towards particular external objects. These affections .
are naturally, and of right, subject to the government of the moral
principle as to the occasions on which they may be gmtified, as to the
times, degreeS, and manner, in which the objects of them may be pur-
sued 3 but then the principle of virtue can neither excite them nor
prevent their being excited. On the contrary, they are naturally felt
when the objects of them are present to the mind, not only before all
consideration whether they can be obtained by lawful means, but after
it is found they cannot. For the natural objects of affection continue
so 3 the necessaries, conveniences, and pleasures of life remain naturally
desirable, though they cannot be obtained innocently, nay, though they
cannot possibly be obtained at all. And when the objects of any
affection whatever cannot be obtained without unlawful means, but
may be obtained by them, such affection‚—though its being excited‚
and its ‹·‹›ntinuiug some time in the mind, be as innocent as it is
natural and necessary,—yet cannot buthe conceived to have a tendency
to incline persons to venture upon such unlawful means 3 and therefore
must be conceived as putting them in some danger of it. . . . This
tendency in some one particular propension may be increased by the
greater frequency of occasions naturally exciting it, than of occasions
exciting others, The least voluntary indulgence in forbidden circum-
stances, though but in thought, will increase this wrong tendency, and
may increase it further till, peculiar conjunctores perhaps conspiring,
