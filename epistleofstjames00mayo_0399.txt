IV 11-13 NOTES 139

καὶ ἄλλα, similarly aye in Latin, of which Servius says (on Aen. ii. 707)
‘ aye ' ozon esc moclo verbum imperantis sed adverbium hortantis, adeo ul
plerumque ‘ ayefcwite' dieamus et singularem numerum copulemus plurali.
In like manner we have Matt. xxvi. 65 ἴδε νῦν ἠκούσατε, Arist. Aah.. 318
εἰπέ μοι τί φειδόμεσθα τῶν λίθων ὦ δημόται ; Pax 385 εἶπέ μοι τί πάσχετ’
ὧνδρες; Plat. Gory. 455 B φέρε δὴ ἴδωμεν, Xen. illem. iii. 4. 7 ’ίθι δὴ ἐξετά-
σωμεν. It is usually followed by an imperative or an interrogative, as
in Cyrop. ii. 1. 6 ἄγε δή, τῆς σῆς δυνάμεως τί φῄς πλῆθος εἶιάι,· and in the
plural as Xen. Anah. v. 4. 9 ἄγετε δὴ, τί ἡμῶν δεήσεσθε; Here it would
seem that the following parenthesis has destroyed the construction and
changed the question οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἀτμίς ἐστιν ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν into the state-
ment οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τὸ τῆς αὔριον κ.τ.λ.

σήμερον ἢ αὕριον.“Ι The reading ἢ of Sin. B. &cn gives a better sense
than καί, which occurs in the same phrase Luke xii. 28, xiii. 32, 33 3 so
χθὲς καὶ σήμερον Heb. xiii. 8. For the warning Cf. Luke Xii. 16 foll„

C. 566 ἔξοιδ’ ἀνὴρ ὢν, χῶτι τῆς ἐς αὔριον οὐδὲν πλέον μοι σοῦ μέτεστιν
ἡμέρας. Wetst. quotes many similar passageS, among them one from
a J ewish story of R. Simeon ben Chal. hearing from the angelos death
that his office was to slay those who boasted of the things they were
about to do.

πορευσόμεθα εἰς τήνδε τὴν πόλιν] ‘We will go 'co this City‚’ pointing
it out on the map. So τόδε in Aristotle gets the force of the particular
as opposed to the yeneral. Erdmann and Beyschlag, reading καί above,
Wrongly translate ‘ we will journey for two days.' The dispersion of
the Jews, which gave them connexions all over the world and let them
know at once of any new opening for trade, led to their being con-
stantly on the move. Thus we read of Aquila and Priscilla at Rome
and at Corinth (Acts xviii. 1, 2), at Ephesus (ib. v. 18), again at Rome
(Rom. xvi. 3) and at Ephesus (2 Tim. iv. 19), see above i. 11 ἐν ταῖς
πορείαις. [See Zahn‚ Weltverkeleo· und Ilio-che, HanOV. 1877. 8.]

ποιήσομεν ἐκεῖ {metm-dv] Cf. Acts XX. 3 ποιήσας μῆνας τρεῖς, ib. XV. 33,
XViii. 23, PrOV. xiii. 23 δίκαιοι ποιήσουσιν ἐν πλούτῳ ἔτη πολλα. The
usage appears to be confined to later Greek, see Shilleto on Dem. RL.
p. 392, Vorst, p. 158 foll. There is a similar phrase in Latin, cf. Sen.
Ep. 66. 4 quamvis paucissimos una fecerimus dies, tamen multi nobis
sermones suerunt.

ἐμπορευσόμεθα] Elsewhere in N.T. only in 2 Pet. ii. 3, where it has
a transitive force. In LXX. (Gen. xxxiV. 10) and in profane authors
it is intransitive as here.

κερδήσομεν] ΝΟ other example of this form of the future is cited.
