(usually dated about A..D 95) it must inevitably have had some
reference to the preceding calamity in which so many Jews of
the Dispersion had been involved. In our Epistle there is a
reference to tribulation, but this arises from the oppression and
persecution of the Christians by rich and prosperous Jews, who
are compared to beasts fattened for slaughter, and over whom it
is said that judgment is already impending: the writer is looking
forward‚ not backward. I need not say how utterly mis-appro-
priate such language would be, if addressed to the erushed and
broken remnant of the Jews in the years immediately following the
utter ruin of their city and temple and nation under Titus. The
leaders of the persecution, the Sadducean hierarchy, had been
exterminated. The wealthier Jews in general, partly from the
hatred of their Gentile neighbours‚ partly from internal animosities,
from desire of revenge for past ill-treatment, or from mere greed
and envy of the rich on the part of the poor, had been plundered
of everything in the reign of terror which prevailed, alike in
Jerusalem itself and generally throughout the East, wherever Jews
were to be found. If here and there a solitary individual had
succeeded in saving some fraetion of his former possessions‚
certainly he had no longer the power to pelseeute others,

f A second mark of time in the Epist-le is its silence as to the

Gentiles should be admitted into the Chur.ch If it was written
after the violent agitation caused by St. Paul's preaching to the
Gentiles and after the decision of the Couneil of Jerusalem (51), it
must surely have contained seme reference to these events. It is
impossible to suppose that St. J ames, who was responsible for the
compromise agreed to at the Council, and who refers to it subse-
quently on a later visit of St. Paul to Jerusalem (Acts xxi. 26),
would have failed to make use of the opportunity to urge the
Jews of the Dispersion to observo the terms of the compact and
deal fairly by their Gentile neighbours. Nor does it seem
possible to accept Dr. Plummer’s suggestion that it may have
been written between 53 and (52 (Sc. Jamcs, p. 61), after the
controversy on the subject had eooled down3 because we have
