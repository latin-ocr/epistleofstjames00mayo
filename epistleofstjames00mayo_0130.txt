cvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

(ιι) In our human 1111010005111 the tongue plays the part of the
world, and it is used by the powers of evil for our
ruin.—iii. 6.

(h) Its malign and devastating influence.—-iii. 5-8.

(ι’) It is like the rudder of a ship: he who can rule it rules
the whole life and activity.—-iii. 2—4.

(3) Inconsistency of supposing that we can offer acceptable praise

to God as long as we speak evil of man who is made in the image
of God.—-iii. 9-12.

VI. Tmo ancl falso IVc'sdom.—iii. 13-18.

(1) The wisdom which comes from God is simple and straight-
forward, full of kindness and all good frum—iii. 13, 17, 18.

(2) If there is a wisdom which does not conduce to peace, but
is accompanied by bitterness and jealousy, it is not from above, but
is earthly‚ carnal, devilish.—-iii. 14-16.

VII. W (wamy (cyccmst qzocomlsmnemess (ond furorldlmossffi-iv. 1-17.

(1) The cause of quarrelling is that each man seeks to gratify
his own selfish impulses, and to snatch his neighbour's portion
of worldly good—iv. 1, 2.

(2) No satisfaction can be thus obtained. Even our prayers can
give us no satisfaction if they are infected with this worldly spirit.
—iv. 3.

(3) God demands the service of the whole heart, and will reveal
Himself to none but those who yield up their wills to His—iv. 4-6.

(4) Therefore resist the devil, who is the prince of this world,
and turn to God in humble repentance.—iv. 7-10.

(5) Cease to find fault with others. Those who condemn their
neighbours condemn the law itself, and usurp the office of Him, the
Lord of life and death, who alone has the power and right to
judge.—iV. 11, 12.

(6) Worldliness is also shown in the confident laying-out of plans
of life without reference to God.-iv. 13-17.

(1) Woe to those who have been heaping up money and living
111 luxury on the very eve of judgment. Woe especially to those ,
who have ground down the poor and murdered the innocent—v, 1-6.
