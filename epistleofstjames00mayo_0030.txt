mle. not being genuine, wishes to be understood as being, the President
of the Chureh at Jerusalem, and tho brother of the Lord.l We
have now to investigate the meaning os this last expression. Is
it to be understood literally of half—brothers of the Lord, sons of
Mary his mother and of Joseph his reputed father? Or is it to
be understood of foster-brothers, sons of his reputed father by
a former wife? Or is it to be understood of the cousins of the
Lord, sons of Clopas or Alphaeus‚ the husband of his mother's
sister, who bore the same name as herself? It may be well first
to bring together the passages bearing on this subject in the
Gospels‚ and then to examine them inore carefully in reference to
the three theories above stated. I quote from the RV.

Τζζξρζζξζή not till she had brought forth a son.

gffl'fflggffl Luke ii. 7. She brought forth her first-born son.

John ii. 12. After this he went down to Capernaum, lie and
his mother and his brethren and his diseiples: and there they
abode not many days.

Matt. xiii. 54—56. And coming into his own country he taught
them in their synagogue, insomueh that they were astonished and
said, Whenee hath this man this wisdoin and these inighty works ’.ἲ
Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary‘?
and his brethren James and Joses and Simon and Judas? And
his sisters are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man
these things?

Mark vi. 3. Is not this the carpentes, the son of Mary, and
brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? and are not
his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him. Cf.
Luke iv. 16—30, John vi. 42.

Matt. xii. 47. While he was yet speaking to the multitudes,
behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to
speak to him. And one said unto him, Behold thy mother and
thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee. But he

a Tandem:- sclrrafl written with the view os minimizing the difl'erence between St. l'aul
and St. damea (1) hei-ause I do not see that it in any way ass'ecfs my argument, unless
it should lw maintained that the writer of the Acts had our Epistle before him and
intentionally imitated its language, which would give an even stronger support to
my argument from a different point os view ; and (2) because the theor)= itsvlf seems
