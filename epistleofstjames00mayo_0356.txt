96 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

προσφέρω as properly describing the ministerial action of the priest‚
while the latter describes the action of the offerer. In the other

, ‘passages 01 the NT. in which Abraham's faith is mentioned it is
x· differently proved: thus in Rom. iv. 1, 17—21 it is the faith in the

promise of a son· in Heb. xi 8-12 it is the departure from his own
111111 to an unknown country3 ib. 17- 19 it is the swifice of Isaac in
the futh that (9(οᾶ would rais ·0 him up again from the dead The

Philo Iris not less than twelve references to Gen. xv. 6 (see Lightfoot
Gal. lc), the most striking passag„ e being M. 1. p. 486 δίκαιον γὰρ
οὕτως οὐδὲν ὡς ἀκράτῳ καὶ ἀμιγεῖ τῇ πρὸς Θεὸν μόνον πίστει κεχρῆσθαι
...τὸ ἐπὶ μόνῳ τῷ ὄντι βεβαίως καὶ ἀκλινῶς ὃρμειν...δικαιοσύνης μόνον
ἔργον. While St. Paul makes no reference to Gen. xvii. 17, in
which Abraham is said to have laughed at the idea that he should
have a son by Sarah (the earlier promise having been made when
he was at least twelve years younger, and having no express reference
to Sarab), Philo endeavours to show that this is no discredit to
Abraham's faith (M 1. p. (505). I borrow from Gfr'Orer cited by Bishop
Lightfoot Lo. p. 154 foll. the following rabbinical quotations ι (Λίσοῖιίῖέα
011 Exod. xiv, 31) ‘ Abraham our father inherited this world and the world
to come solely by the merit of the faith whereby he believed in God’ ;
(Siphre on Deut. xi. 13) ‘ The sacred text¹ nie-ms to show that practice
depends on doctrine and not doctrine on practice: and so we find God
punishes more severely for doctline than for practice, as it is said

“mastered the thirteen heals of the saith, fiimly believing therein...
though he may have sinned in every possible way...still he inherits
oternal life! It is to such views Justin refers (To-yphv. 370 D) οὐχ ὡς

Θεὸν δὲ γινώσκουσιν, οὐ μὴ λογίσηται αὐτοῖς Κύριος ἁμαρτίαν.

ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον.] Gen. XXii. 9 ἐπέθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσ. The
word, which is not found 111 classica] writers, is used of the Jewish
material altar or the Christian spiritual altar in the N.T.‚ LXX„ Philo
Josephus, and later writers. See wesema, Hebraeos, p. 453ff.
