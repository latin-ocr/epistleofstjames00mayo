IV 1-17 THE DIVINE JEALOUSY 213

ordained that the world shall never give satisfaction, he who seeks
his happiness there cannot but feel himself continually thwarted in his
ambitions, until at last he conceives himself to be the victim of some
jealous and hostile power seated upon the throne of the universe. Yet
‘ He giveth more grace.’ Underneath the dark suspicion which
blots out heaven from our eyes we are dimly conscious of an
appeal to feelings long lost sight of and all but extinct within us.
In the Prodigal's heart there begins to arise a loathing, not only for
the husks with which he has striven to satisfy the cravings of the
immortal soul, but also a loathing for his own folly and sin, a longing
for the home which he has forsaken‚ joined with the sense of his
own unworthiness‚ which makes him fear lest he should have lost it
for ever. To one thus humbled grace is given in full measure:
the soul. which could never satisfy its thirst from earthly cisterns,
finds never-failing supplies of happiness in that inner union with Gocl

Does St. J ames mean that God's grace and favour are to be won by
fasting and sels-discipline? Not so3 God's loving favour is ours to
receive, the moment we believe in it. He means ‘be willing to give
up what has till now seemed to be the chief interest 01 your life: give

atone, 80 far as may be, for any wrongs you have done to others.
Listen for the voice of God in conscience, and do your duty, as in His
sight and relying on His strength, with all the more energy in pro-
portion to its irksomeness and diffieultyss The natural accompaniments
01 such feelings and resolutions amongst the Jews were weeping and
fasting‚ the rending of clothes and the casting 01 dust on the head.
If these things help the inward change, good : if they are its natural
accompaniments‚ good also: but, if they are used as substitutes for
the inner change, or as an anodyne to quiet the conscience and pave
the way 101· the resumption 01 the former life, then they are nothing

gettjer than the vain religion (θρησκεία μάταιος) already condemned by

Are we then never to find fault with others‘l It may be an essen-

right and wrong 3 and so in every case where instruction or criticism
is required. What St. J ames means is that we are not to indulge in
the habit 01 fault-finding from the mere love of it, where duty does
