ful to thyself, (10 11013 130 thy fellow‚’ and that the rest was only 00111-
mental-y} The phrase ὁ πλησίον is classical (as also ὃ πέλας). We
find it without a following gen. in Rom. xiii. 10, xv. 23 τὸν ἕτερον 15
used as its equivalent in Rom. xiii. 8, 500 Vorst, pp. 67, 562.

καλῶς aronam] Used ironically below ver. 19, but here simply as 111

gseyxcsspevot‘ ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου.] ⁴ Being convicted by the laW,' personified

as witness, so 4 Mace. 5. 33 ὦ παιδευτὰ νόμε, cf. Rom. vii. 7, Gal. iii.
94. So we have ὑπὸ τὴς συνειδήσεως ἐλεγχόμενοι 111 the disputed passage
John viii. 9. The reference is probably to the law of love which they
had broken by dishonouring the poor. [Or to LeV. xix. 5 μὴ θαυμάσῃς
πρόσωπον δυναστοῦ. A]

ὡς παραβάται.] Similarly Homer uses ὑπερβαίνω and ὑπερβασίη Il. i.
497. Παραβαίνω with an object, such as νόμους, and even θεούς (see
Herod. vi. 12), or absolutely (Aesch. Ay. 59), is quite classical3 but the
only certain example of this use of παραβάτης 111 a 0105510οΙ author is
from the treatise περὶ τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ θαυμαζομένων ποταμῶν of Polemo
(fl. about 180 Rc.) παραβάτης γενόμενος τῶν θεῶν ap. llffacrob. Sat. V. 19.
The metaphor is adapted to the idea of righteousness as the way in
which a man should walk. It occurs absolutely Gal. ii. 18, with νόμου
below ver. 11 and in Rom. ii. 25, 27 23 παράβασις 15 used by. St. Paul
and in Heb. ii. 2, ix. 15, and παραβαίνω 111 131115 501150 Matt. XV. 2, 3.

10. ὅστις ὅλον τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ] ‘WVhoever keeps the law as 0 whole‚'
ef. Gal. v, 3. When ὅστις takes the subj. it is usually joined with
ἂν, 05 111 Matt. X. 33, Xii. 50, Luke X. 35, John ii. 5, xiv. 13, Acts iii.
23, Gal. V. 103 when ἄν 15 omitted, the constant confusion of -ει and
-η 111 13110 MSS. makes it difficult to know whether the fut. or aor. subj.
15 the true reading. Beside this verse WH. give ὅστις ἀρνήσηται Matt.
x. 33. In classica] Greek ἂν 15 occasionally omitted, both in poetry, as
Eur. Ion. 856 ὅστις ἐσθλὸς ᾗ, Medea 516, and in prose, as Thuc. iv. 18. 4
οἵτινες νομίσωσι, ib. 17. 2 οὗ ἀρκῶσι, see Kijhner 01] Xen. Allem. i. 6. 13
ὅστις ποιῆται, VVinel‘, p. 386, A. Buttmann, 197. We find ἕως λάβῃ
without ἂν below V. 7, where see n. On the Hellenistic 1150 of τηρεῖν
with such words 05 νόμον 500 Vorst, p. 191 foll.

πταίσῃ δὲ ἐν ἑνί.] For πτ. see below iii. 2, Rom. xi. 11. It 15 a
question whether ἑνί and the following πάντων should be regarded as
masculine (agreeing with νόμῳ, νόμων) 01· neuter. It does not seem
that νόμος 15 ever used in the Bible of a particular precept = ἐντολή.
