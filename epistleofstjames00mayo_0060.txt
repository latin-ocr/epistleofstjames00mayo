xxxvi THE EPJSTLE OF ST. JAMES

than as a contumacious setting up of an artificial tradition above
the written Word, if we insist upon it that ‘ brother' must mean,
not brother, but either cousin or one who is no blood-relation at all ;
that ‘first-born' does not iniply other children subsequently born;
that the limit fixed to separation (locs not imply subsequent
union ἲ

The conclusion then, to which our discussion leads, is that James
the Lord's brother was son of J oseph and Mary, brought up with
Jesus until his eighteonth year at any rate‚not one of the Twelve, not
even a disciple till the very end of our Saviour's life, but convinced,
as it would seem, by a special appearance to him of the risen Lord,
and joining the company of the disciples before the day of Pente-
cost. After the martyrdom of Stephen, when the Apostles were
scattered from Jerusalem, we find James holding a position of
authority in the Church of Jerusalem (Gal. i. 18, 19, Acts xii. 17),
which, as we may probably conjecture, had been conceded to him
as brother os the Lord, and retaining this position till the end
of his life.

Further particulars are supplied by Josephus, Ηοσ gesippus, the
Gospel according to the Hebrews, and other Apocryphal books,
including in 111030 the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions.
We have to be on our guard against the Ebionite tendencies of
some of these writers, and their delight in puerile marvels and
ascetic practices, but we may perhaps accept the general outline
as correct, since 81. James occupied a prominent position, and
the facts were for the most part patent to all the world, in
marked contrast with the circumstances of the infancy and child-
hood of our Lord.

The Gospel according to the Hebrews, which Bp. Lightsoot
speaks of as ‘one of the earliest and most respectable of the
apocryphal narratives’ (Gal. p. 274), is quoted by J erome (Dc Vir.
Illustr. 2) to the following effect: The gospel known as that
according to the Hebrews‚ which I have translated into Greek and

s. Latin, and which is often referred to by Origen, tells us that the

Lord after his resurrection appeared to ‹James‚ who had sworn that
he would not eat broad from tho hour in which he had drunk the
cup of the Lord till he saw him risen from the dead. 503113 111010-
