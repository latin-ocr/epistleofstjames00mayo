196 COMMENT

it is so easy, so comforting to be a good hater, to take for granted
that one's own side has a monopoly of intellect and virtue, to
accept the party watch—word and join in shouting the party war-
cry ; so arduous and so humbling to divest oneself of prejudice, to
seek the truth for its own sake, to acknowledge the evil in ourselves,
and see the good in those who differ from us.

Monns OF SELF-Dsscnr'rtoN.

St. James notices in this chapter four ways in which men may
delude themselves as regards their religious state in God’s sight, and
preach peace to themselves when there is no peace. The first is by
their fiuency in speaking on religious subjects, the second by their
religious zeal, the third by their pleasure in hearing sermons or
reading religious books, the fourth (see verses 26 and 27) by the
punctiliousness of their religious services. Not that any one of these
is in itself wrong 3 they may be all good and right as means of grace ;
but they are easily capable of becoming a source of self-delusion,

because it is so easy to confound the means with the end. Thus ¹

under the old dispensation Isaiah (i. 10—20) was commissioned to
declare the utter worthlessness of sacrifices and incense, of sabbaths
and holidays, of solemn meetings and many prayers, unless they were
accompanied by a moral change, unless the worshippers ceased to do
evil, and learnt to do well,—a change exemplified in Isaiah, as in
St. Jmnes, by kindness shown to the orphan and the widow. In
like manner Micah (vi. 6 foll.) contrasts the externalities of a
sacrificial worship with that which the Lord requires, justice, mercy,
humility. The same contrast is found in the New Testament, as
in John iv. 20—24, where Christ himself corrects the Samaritan
woman's ideas of the special sanctity attaching to one place above

another, in the words ‘God is a Spirit, and they that worship ¹

him must worship him in spirit and in truth ’ ; and again in Matt. vii.
21—23, where He declares that, to many who have prayed aud
prophesied and wrought miracles in His name, it shall here-after be
said ‘I never knew you3 depart from me, ye that work iniquity.’

In his next chapter St. James specifies a fifth mode of sels-deception‚ Ι

arising from confidence in the orthodoxy of our creed : ‘ thou believest
that there is one God 3 thou doest well: the devils also believe, and
tremble.' To all these various semblances of religion—not necessarily
hypocritical semblances‚ for it is not a seeming to others, but a seeming
to sels, which is condemned in the εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι of the 26th
verse—he opposes the reality, οὐ γὰρ δοκεῖν ἄριστος ἀλλ’ εἶναι θέλω.
