viii THE EPISTLE OF ST. ‹JAMES

I think any 0110 reading these passages for the first time, without
any preconeeived idea on the subject, would naturally take what
is called the Helvidian vieW, that the brethren of the Lord were
sons of 5 oseph and Mary. It will be seen, however, that there is
much to be said in favour of the other views mentioned above.
We will examine first the argument in favour of the Hieronymian
theory—that those who are called brethren were really 0005105.1

'lhis theory was put forward about the year 383 A..D as a
110101 hypothesis² by 50101110 111 answ er to Helvidius, who had
a·tt acked the prevailino· view of the superiority of the unmarried to
the married state by referring to the example of the Lord's mother.
‘ of whom we read in Scripture that she bore children to her husband
Joseph? Jerome's argument briefly stated is, that James the
brother of the Lord is called an Apostle by St. Paul, that he must
therefore be identified with James the son of Alphaeus‚ since
James the son of Zebedee was 110 longer living when Paul wrote3
identified also with 5 aines the less 10 Mark xv, 40 (the compara-
tive implying an opposition to James the greater? viz. the son of
Zebedee), this James being there stated to be brother of 50505,
But in Mark vi. 3 we find a James and Joses among the brethren
of 50505, and this agrees with John xix. 25, where Mary the
mother of 5011105 and wife of Alphaeus is called Mary of Clopas,
sister of the Lord‘s mother; from whence it follows that the four
brothers and two or more sisters mentioned in Mark vi. 3 and
elsewhere are really first cousins of 50505. 50101110 himself had no
