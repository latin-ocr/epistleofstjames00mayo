84 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

other instance-s named by XViner are 1 Thess. i. 9 δουλεύειν Θεῷ
ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ (which might there be indefinite, ‘ to serve a.
living and true Go‹l‚’ in conti-ast with the preceding ἐπεστρέψατε ἀπὸ
τῶν εἷὸώλων; see however Westcott on Heb. iii. 12 ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ Θεοῦ
ζῶντος ‘ the anarthrous title, which is far more common than ὁ Θ. ὁ ζῶν,
always fixos attention upon the character as distinguished from the
‘⁶ Person '' of God. In every case it suggests a ground for corresponding
thought or action ’), and the constantly recum-ing Πνεῦμα ἅγιον, which is
used not only aftcr a preposition, as in Matt. i. 18 εὑρέθη ἐν γαστρὶ
ἔχουσα ἐκ Πνεύματος ἁγίου, but also without a preposition and even in the
nominative, eg. Luke i. 15 Πνεύματος ἁγίου πλησθήσεται, V. 35 Πνεῦμα
ἅγιον ἐπελεύσεται ε’πὶ σε’, ib. ii. 25 Πνεῦμα ἦν ἅγιον ἐπ’ αὐτόν. It is notice-
able that, when there is no article, the words are always in this order,
but, with the article, τὸ ἅγιον Πν. is not much less common than τὸ Πν.
τὸ ely-¹ We may compare also Luke i. 17 μνησθῆναι διαθήκης ἁγίας
αὐτοῦ and other exx. given in the Essay on Grammar. The phrase
νόμον τελεῖτε is only found here and in Rom. ii. 27. The commandment
of love on which all others hang (Rom. xiii. 8, Gal. v, 14) is rightly
called ‘supreme' βασιλικός; so Philo M ii. 459 οἱ σοφοὶ βασιλικώτερον
οὐδὲν ἀρετῆς νομίζοντες, ib. p. 364 βασιλικὴν εἴωθεν ὀνομάζειν Μωῧσῆς ὁδὸν
τὴν μέσην ὑπερβολῆς καὶ ἐλλείψεως οὖσαν μεθόριον, ib. M i. p. 526 astro-
nomy is βασιλὶς τῶν ἐπιστημῶν. Zahn (Gesclz. Neut. Kan. i. 323>
compares Clem. Al. Strom. vi. p. 164, the Scripture says ‘if your
righteousness do not exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees ' (whose
righteousness consisted only in abstaining from evil, σὺν τῷ μετὰ τῆς
ἐν τούτοις τελειώσεως) καὶ τῷ τὸν πλησίον ἀγαπᾶν καὶ εὐεργετεῖν δύνασθαι,
οῧκ ἔσεσθε βασιλικοί, il). vii. 73 ὅταν μὴ κατ’ ἀνάγκην ἢ φόβον ἢ ἐλπίδα
δίκαιός τις ᾗ ἀλλ’ ἐκ προαιρέσεως, αὕτη ἡ ὁδὸς λέγεται βασιλικὴ ἣν τὸ βασιλικὸν
ὁδεύει γένος. Clement's use reminds one of βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα (ΕΧ. xix. 6,
1 Pet. ii. 9). And this would make excellent sense. Christ's law is not
addressed to slaves, who must obey whether they will or not, but to
kings who voluntarily embrace the law as their guide: cf. the Stoic
paradox in Hor. Ep. i. 1. 106. Α curiously close verba] resemblance
is found in pseudo-Plato Ellinos 317 C τὸ μὲν ὀρθὸν νόμος ἐστὶ βασιλικός,
τὸ δὲ μὴ ὀρθὸν οὔ, where βασιλικός apparently means ‘ worthy of a states-
1nan‚' it having becu stated just before that laws are the compositions
of those who know how to rule states, viz. οἱ πολιτικοί τε καὶ οἱ βασιλι-
κοί; cf. id. Ep. 8. p. 354 (J.

κατὰ. τὴν γραῲήν.] Of course the Ο.Τ. viz. Lev. xix. 18, of which the
text is an exact quotation, cf. l Cor. xv. 3 κατὰ τὰς γραφάς.

ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς ‹reum-612] In Hellenistic Greek, as in
HebreW‚ the fut. is often used for imperat. eg. Matt. v. 48 ἔσεσθε ὑμεῖς
τέλειοι, ib. Vi. 5 οὐκ ἔσεσθε ὡς οἶ ὑποκριταί, Rom. vii. 7 οὖκ ἐπιθυμήσειςῑ
this is very rarely tho case in classical Greek, see WViner, p. 396.
The law, which is limitet] in Leviticus by the context οὗ μηνιεῖς τοῖς
υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ σου, receives the widest significance as re-uttered by Christ
Luke x. 27 foll„ John xv. 12. Hillel is said to have told a proselyte
that the essence of the law was contained in the saying ⁴ what is hate-
