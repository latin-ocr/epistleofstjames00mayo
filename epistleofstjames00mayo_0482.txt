222 COM MENT

‘The object of the passage is to encourage the exero-ise of those
mutual spiritual aids rendered by Christians to each other, which is
one of the great objects and privileges os the institution of the
Chul-rh. The body was to sympathize with its several members. lf
a inan was in trouble, he was to pray3 if in joy, to sing hymns: in
neither vaso is the Apostle speaking of private prayer or private
singing; but ol' those of the Christian congregationl: there every
individua] (eliu-istisin could find the bost relief for his sorrows, and the
livelicst sympathy in his joy. St. Paul's command “Rejoice with
them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep,” applies to this
same sympathy, which the prayers and hymns of the church services
wore a constant means of expressing. But if a man were sick and
could not go to the congregation, still he was not to lose the benefit of
his Christian communion with them, he might then ask them to
come to him, and as the whole congregation could not thus be
summoned, the elders were to go as its representatives, and their
prayers were to take the place of the prayers of the whole church.
Care, however, is taken to show that the virtue of their prayers arises
not from their being priests, but from their being Christians‚ and
standing in the place of the whole church. For these words im—
mediately follow: “confess therefore to one another your sins, and
pray for one another, that ye may be healed 3 there is much virtue in
a just inan’s prayer, when it is offered earnestly.'' Now, this most
divine system of a living Church, in which all were 130 aid each other,
in which each man might open his heart to his neighbour and receive
the help of his prayers, and in which each man's earnest prayer,
offered in Christ’s name, had so high a promise of blessing annexed to
it, has been almost2 destroyed by that notion of a priesthood, which
claiining that men should confess their sins to the clergy, not as to
thcir biethren, but as to God's vicegerents, and confining the promised
blessing to the prayers of the clergy as priests, not as Christians, nor
as the representives of the whole church, has changed the sympathy
of a Christian society into the dominion of a priesthood and the
mingled carelessness and superstition of a laity.

‘ St. John’s language agrees with that of St. J ames: “If any inan
see his brother sinning a sin which is not unto death, he shall pray‚
and Christ shall give him life, for those who are not sinning unto
death. There is a sin unto death 3—it is not for that that I am
bidding him to pray.'' Here the very same blessing which St. James
speaks of as following the elders' prayers is said by St. John to follow
the prayer of any Christian, a clear proof that the elders were sent
for as representatives of the Church, and not as if their prayers
possessed a peculial· virtue, because they stood as priests between God
and the people.'

¹ I cannot agree with Arnold in confining the exhortation to congregational
singing 01· prayer.
