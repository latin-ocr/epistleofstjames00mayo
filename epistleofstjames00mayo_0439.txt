Ι 1-15 πειρασμός-πειράζεσθαι 179

Trial 10515 saith 3 the testing of faith produces endurance, endur-
ance, if it is continued till it attains 115 end, builds up the perfectly
matured Christian character, thoroughly furnished to all good works.
For an example of this testing of the saith, patiently endured to the
end, we may take the Syro-Phoenician woman. It is manifest what
strength of endurance, what unshaken trust in God, she must have
gained through that one victory. The converse is equally true.
Where there has been little trial, there has been little to test and
exercise faith, little experience of oui-selves, little to instil the habit of
submission and resignation, little to lead us away from earth and up
to heaven. The old Greek proverb, παθήματα μαθήματα, is adopted by
the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews‚ and applied where, without
1115 sanction 110 might have hardly ventured to apply it, in the words
καίπερ ὢν υἱὸς ἔμαθεν ἀφ’ ὧν ἔπαθεν τήν ὑπακοήν.

But is not St. James' exhortation to rejoice in temptation
opposed to the petition ‘Lead us not into temptation,‘ where the
same word πειρασμός is used in the same signification of externa]
temptation‘ss In the Lord's Prayer however there is no reason
to limit its application to pain-temptation any more than in 1 Tim.
vi. 9 (they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare). In
the next place one who is conscious of his own weakness may
without inconsistency pray that 110 may be kept out of tempta-
tion, and yet, when he is brought into it through no fault of 1115
own but by God’ 5 piovidential ordeiing, he may feel such trust in
Div· 100 supp01t as to rejoice in an oppmtunity of pr oving his faithful—
0055. St. James speaks to those who are in the midst of trial, and 111
danger of losing heait 111 consequence. it was evidently not God’ 5 will
that they should be kept out of temptation, but that they should turn
it to good account 3 and this is what St. J ames encourages them to do.
Another way of explaining the difficulty 15 by a comparison of the
words in Matt. XXVi. 41 προσεύχεσθε ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἷς πειρασμόν. The
disciples to whom J esus addressed these words were already in a situa-
tion of extreme trial, and he does not propose to remove them from it z
they are all to be sifted. Still they are to pray that they may not
enter into temptation‚ 1,0. that they may be 50 supported by Divine
grace as to go through trial without its being able to tempt them. J
do not think however that there is any need to limit in this way the
meaning of the petition in the Lord’s Prayer.

Allowing that St. James 15 here thinking mainly of trial arising
out of afflicffion, how far may we generalize his ‘divers temptations '2
Beside pain, sorrow, sear, it will certainly embrace all sorts of per-
plexities, difficulties, disappointments, anxieties, anything which
troubles or annoys us. We are naturally inclined to wish them out
of the way, to think of them simply as interfering with the comfort
and happiness which we esteem our light. The true way is to reg ud
them as part of 0111 schooling for heaven, helping to fonn the 01055
which has to be boine by eveiy Chlistian. We should strengthen
0111501105 to beai them by looking away from the pain to the

good involved in it, if rightly 1101110. But may we also 1e2joice in
