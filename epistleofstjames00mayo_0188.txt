clxiv THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

intended to emphasizo the contrast by bringing together the con-
trasted nouns, as in ii. 13, of which I have spoken above :
v. 20 πολὺ ἰσχύει δέησις δικαίου ἐνεργουμένη ‘ tho suppli-
cation of a righteous man availeth much in its working'
might perhaps bo better translated ‘a righteous man's suppli-
cation availeth much when actuated by the Spu-it) iii. 18
καρπὸς δὲ δικαιοσύνης ἐν εἰρήνῃ σπείρεται, here. it is to be
noted that καρπ. δικ. is a phrase found in Phil. i. 11, Heb. xii.
11, as well as in Amos vi. 2, Prov. xi. 30, and is therefore liable to
the abbreviation which naturally attaches to all proverbial expres-
sions. Possibly also the writer may have felt that the proleptic
use of καρπός would have acquired additional harshness if the
article were prefixed. It would have been natural to say τὸ
σπέρμα σπείρεται, but καρπός is not that which is sown, but
that which it is hoped will spring up. Peaceful sowing results in
righteousness as its fruit.

I proceed to the case of anarthrous epithets where the English has
the definite article. Such are v. 3 ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ‘in the
last days,' which occurs also in 2 Tim. iii. 1 : it may be compared
with 1 John ii. 18 ἐσχάτη ὥρα ἐστίν, 1 Pet. i. 5 ἐν καιρῷ ἐσχάτῳ,
Sir. i. 11 εὖ ἔσται ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων, and even ii. 3 ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων σου.
On the other hand we find ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις Acts ii. 17,
and τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ seven times in St. John's Gospel. In James
v. 7 the RV. ‘ until it receive the early and the latter rain ' stands
for the Greek ἕως λάβῃ πρόϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον. In this last case
both article and substantive are dropped by colloquial abbreviation,
as we have ‘ Paul's' in old writers for ‘ St. Paul's church.’

In English we join the article with the superlative, even when

it forms part of the predicate3 whereas the Greeks always omitted
it in, such cases (6.9. πάντων φιλομαθέστατος Κῦρος ἣν), and also
where the superlative denotes a high degree of any quality, as
James iii. 4 ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστου πηδαλίου. Similarly the Classical
writers omit the article with the ordinal numeral, as Thuc. V. 81
τέταρτον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα, and so, iu Matt.
XX. 3 and elsewhere, we find expressions like περὶ τρίτην ὥραν.
The omission is probably to be accounted for by the wish to
shorten familiar expressions where there is no danger of misunder-
standing being caused by it, just as wo might say ‘ 7th Victoria‚'
or ‘Acts seven ‘two'
