cxxvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

of the Dispersion. The argument derived from the ‘condition of the
churches’ is more fully stated in Davidson's Introduction (1868) I.
288, ‘ Distinctious of places in Christian churches, an ambitious
love of preeminence, an unworthy partiality for the rich, are in-
consistent with an early period.’ ‘Amid the worldly views and
arrangements which prevailed in these Christian assemblies early
Christian love had grown cold.'

I have only two faults to find with this argument. It is
contradicted, first, by all we know of the facts of the case, and,
secondly, by general experience. All the evidence we have
as to the state of the early Church from the baptism of Christ
to the last record in the Acts is opposed to these dreams of an
ideal perfectiori. It is unnecessary to refer to ‘the ambitious love
of preeminence,' the faitlilessuess, the narrowness, which marked
even the greatest of the Apostles during our Lord's lifetime.
Let us start with the day of Pentecost. Take the early
chapters of the Acts ; how long did the state of things
described in the fourth chapter continue? How long could it be
said that the multitude of them that believed were of one heart
and one soul and had all things in common? In the very next
chapter we find Ananias and Sapphira lying to the Holy Ghost : in
the sixth chapter the Crecian Jews murmur against the Hebrews
because their widows were neglected in the daily visitation: in the
eighth chapter Simon wishes to purchase spiritual gifts with money :
in the fifteenth chapter we read of the jealousy of the Jews towards
the Gentiles, which almost proved fatal to the infant Church : in the
nineteenth Paul meets with disciples who had not so much as heard
‘whether there be any Hol y Ghost ' : in the twentieth he warns the
elders of the Church at Ephesus that after his departure ‘grievous
wolves shall enter in, yea, from among your own selves shall men
arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after
them '2 in the twenty-first it seems that Christian Jews joined with
others who were zcalous for the law, in the attempt to kill Paul.
lf we turn to the Epistles, we sind in Rom. ii: and xiv. many of the
saults condemned by St. James. The Corinthians within five years of
their conversion are broken up by schisms z they are as much given
to vainglory and jealousy and strife and censorious judgments as
the churches to which St. James writes. They are more addicted
to sins of the flesh ; they indulge to excess even when they meet
