answered ι ‘ By ceasing to desire? The Christian answer is : ‘ By desii-ing
to be and to do what God wius, and by desii-ing others‘ good rather

We are familiar with the Greek idea of Nemesis. Excessive
prosperity on the part of man even apart from evil-doing, asin the
well-known story of the Ring of Polycrates, portended utter ruin,
because it provoked the divine jealousy of human happiness. We are
familiar also with the ascription of jealousy to the God of the Jews,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation. This seems to 115 to belong to the same stage
01 thought as the lem talionis ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth3’ or as the expulsion of Adam out of Eden for fear that he might
put forth his hand and eat of the tree of life 3 or again as the dispersion
of mankind over the face of the earth, 101· fear that they might make
themselves too strong by building the tower of Babel. Such concep-
tions seem to us natura] to the anthropomorphism of a rude people and
period, when even Moses could urge as a reason for sparing the
israelites the fear that the Egytians might say, ‘because the Lord
was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, he
hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.' But under
the New Dispensation we are perhaps surprised that it should still be
possible to make use of a figure which seems derogatory to the Divine
Perfection. We think jealousy a defect in human love 3 how much more
in Divine! The phrase itself is no doubt due to the writer's Hebraic
tone of thought and speech 3 but it is at the same time a most forcible
expression of a most important truth3 and the addition ‘He giveth
more grace ' removes from it all that is unamiable in the idea of jea-
lousy. It is really a parable in which the soul is represented as
standing between rival wooers, God and the world. The strongest
human passion is boldly taken to represent the Divine longing for the
entire possession of the human heart, i.e. for the expulsion of every
thought and feeling which intel-feres with the recovery of the Divine
image in man and the attainment of the perfect ideal of humanity.
We blame human jealousy, because it is so largely made up of a selfish
desire for our own pleasure and honour 3 so liable to turn into hatred
of the object of our passion. The Divine jealousy, as depicted in the
N .T., desii-es nothing but the best good of the beloved object, and hates
nothing but that which would injure and (leg-rade it. How is this
jealousy concerned in ‘resisting the proud, and giving grace to the
humble’? Pride here consists in man’s claim to be independent of
God, to do what he likes and gratify all his natural impulsos irre-
spective of God’s will. It is the choice 01 the temporal in preference
to the eternal, of the world in preference to God. This pride is re-
sisted, as was shown in the previous comment, by the continual failure
to obtain the happiness sought for. The Divine jealousy having
