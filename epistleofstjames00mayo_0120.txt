xcvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

common quotations from the O.T., are such as to prove conclusively
that the one borrowed from the other. Nor can there be much
doubt as to which of the two was the borrower‚ if we observe hoW‚
in almost every case, the common thought finds fuller expression
in St. Peter. Thus both Epistles are addressed to⁸ the Diaspom,
but in St. Peter we have the distinctive touch ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπι-
δήμοις διασπορᾶς. St. J ames addresses the Twelve Tribes of the
Diaspora without limitati0n3 but his letter, as I have argued in
the chapter on the persons Addrcsscd, would probably be circulated
mainly among the Jews of the Eastern Dispersion ; while St. Peter,
writing, as I imagine, during the iinprisonment of St. Paul at
Rome to the Jews of Asia Minor, with the view of removing their
prejudices against his teaching‚ took the Epistle of St. J ames as
his model, but ingrafted upon it the more advanced Christian
doctrine which he shared with St. Paul. If we ac‘cept the genuine-
ness of the Second Epistle, we shall find an interesting parallel in
the close relation between it and the Epistle of St. Jude. These
however are of course matters of more or less uncertainty. But
the close connexion between J ames i. 2 and 1 Pet. i. 6, 7 is proved
beyond all doubt by the recurrence in both of the phrases ποικί-
λοις πειρασμοῖς and τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως with its un-
usual order of words. Assuming then, as we must, that one copied
from the other, we find the trial of faith illustrated in St. Peter (as
in Psa. lxvi. 10, Prov. xvii. 3, Job xxiii. 10, Zech. xiii. 9, Mal. iii. 3)
by the trying of the precious metals in the fire: we find also the
addition, ὀλίγον ἄρτι, εἰ δέον, λυπηθέντες, which looks as if it were
intended to soften down the uncompromising Stoicism of St.
Jaines' πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε. Again comparing James i. 18
and 1 Pet. i. 23, we find the bare ‘begat he us with the word of
truth' of the former expanded into ‘having been begotten again
not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of
God which liveth and abideth.' So in 1 Pet. ii. 1, 2, the simpler
expression of J ames (i. 21) ‘ WVherefore putting away all filthiness
and overflowing of malice, receive with meekness the implanted
word which is able to save your souls ' is elaborated into ‘ Putting
away therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and
envies and all evil speakings, as newborn babes long for the
spiritual (λογικόν) milk which is without guile, that ye may grow
thereby unto salvation.' Compare also James i. 12 with 1 Pet. v, 4
