ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF ST. JAMES cciii

καλῶς, the supercilious neglect of the poor σὺ στῆθι ἐκεῖ ἢ κάθου
ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου. With a similar fine irony he paints the
behaviour 01 the soi-disant philanthropist‚ ‘If a brother or sister
be nakcd and in lack 01 daily food, and one of you say to them,
Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled, and yet ye give them not
the things needful to the body; what does it profit 2 ' Even error
of doctrine receives the same dramatic treatment, eg. 1. 13 ‘ Let
no man say when he is tempted ὅτι ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πειράζομαι’ ; 6οᾶ 50
111 11. 18 1011. where the vanity of faith without works is exposed3
and iv. 13 foll. where the worldly feeling on one side, and the reli—
gious feeling on the other, are embodied in the contrasted speeches‚
‘To-day or to-morrow we will go to this city, and spend a year
there, and trade and get gain,' and again ‘ If the Lord will, we
shall live and do this or that? In further illustration of what I
understand by the quality of vividness I will only instance the
frequent reference to 6Χ6111Ρ165, 511011 65 Abraham, Rabab, J ob
Ἔῑῐῗῖᾷᾞ, 6οᾶ the peisonification of the Law 111 iv. 11, of the Tongue
in iii. 1—8. Suffice it to say that it pervades the whole of the
Epistle, and is markedly seen in the detailed particularity of the
descriptions, such as that of the oppression of the rich in v. 1—6.
All this tends to give vivacity and energy to the style. Other

 

frequent use of interrogation and 01 the imperative mood. It is

*scarcely worth ΜΨ, but Ι will just refer to v. 13ί Is
any among you suffering? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let
him sing praise. Is any among you sick? let him call for the
elders of tbe church': for the imperative, compare i. 2 and
following verses, ’πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε-ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον
τέλειον ἐχέτω-αἰτείτω-μὴ οἰέσθω-καυχάσθω. Compare too
the sudden apostrophes‚ μὴ πλανᾶσθε-ἴστε-ἀκούσατε-θέλεις

δὲ Μῃ-ὁρᾶτε-ἴδε-ἰδού-ἄνγε νυν.
