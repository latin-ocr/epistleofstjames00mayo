truth that he who was to be born of Mary was VERY GOD OF VERY
GOD‚ so there is nothing in the Subsequent life of Mary which
would lead us to believe that she, any more than his Apostles, had
realized it before his Resurrection. On the contrary, it is plain
that such a belief fully realized would have made it impossible for
her to sulfil, I do not say her duties towards her husband, but her
duties towards the Lord himself during his infancy and childhood.
It is hard enough even now to hold together the ideas of the
Humanity and Divinity of Christ without doing violence to either;
but to those who knew him in the flesh we may safely say it was
impossible until the Comforter had come and revealed it unto them.
As to what should be the relations between the husband and wife
after the birth of the promised Child there is one thing we may be
sure of, viz. that these would be determined not by personal con-
siderations, but either by immediate inspiration, as the journey to
Egypt and other events had been, or, in the absence of this, by the
one desire to do what they believed to be best for the bringing up
of the Child entrusted to them. We can imagine their feeling it
to be a duty to abstain from bringing other children into the
world, in order that they might devote themselves more exclusively
to the nurture and training of Jesus. On the other hand, the
greatest prophets and saints had not been brought up in solitude.
Moses, Samuel and David had had brothers and sisters. It might
be God's will that the Messiah should experience in this, as in
other things, the common lot of man. VVhichever way the Divine
guidance might lead them, we may be sure that the response of
Mary would be still as before, ‘ Behold the handmaid of the Lord,
be it unto me according to thy word?
