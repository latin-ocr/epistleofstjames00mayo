οὐκ ἀπείρατον αὐτοῖς, Pind. Ol. viii. 60 κουφότεραι γὰρ ἀπειράτων φρένεςῑ
the Ionic form occurs Hom. Od. ii. 170, Herod. vii. 9. 3 ἔστω μηδὲν ἀπείρη-
τον· αὐτόματον γὰρ οὐδέν, ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ πείρης πάντα ἀνθρώποισι.

In accordance with the use of ἀπείρατος Alford translates ‘ unversed
in things evil ' 3 so Hofmann (‘B‹>·semfre7ml oder vom Uebeln unbem-offen,
auf keinem Fall aber von Bb'sem oder zu Bbsem unversuclet oder unver-
suclzbar’), Briickner, Erdmann. Others (Vulg. Aeth. Lutlier) give it
an active sense, ‘God is not one who tempts to evil.' The latter
interpretation would make the next clause (πειράζει δέ) mere tautology,
and it has now no defenders. It seems to me that the case is equally
strong against the former interpretation. The meaning of the rare
word ἀπείραστος must be determined from the general force of πειράζω
in the Nm, and especially from the following clause, which is evidently
intended to be its exact correlative in the active voice (ἀπείρασ-
τος; πειράζει δὲ αὐτός). The relation of the two clauses would have been
more clearly marked if μὲν had been added after ἀπ.; compare for its
omission J elf ξ 767, and below ii. 2, 11. Further it is impossible to read
this sentence without being reminded of very similar phrases used
about God by Philo and other post-Aristotelian philosophers, cf. Philo

οὐδεμίαν ἐν ἑαυτῷ αἰτίαν ἔχει τοῦ κακοποιεῖν· κακίαν γὰρ οὐκ ἔχει, οὐδέ τι κακῶς

which is compared here by Oecumenius 3 see my note on Cic. Ν .D. i. 45.
For the gen. κακῶν, which is perhaps more easily explained as meaning ‘ ιο
evil’ than ‘ by evil‚' see Xen. Cyrop. iii. 3. 55 ἀπαίδευτος ἀρετῆς, W'iner,
p. 242, who compares 2 Pet. ii. 14 καρδίαν γεγυμνασμένην πλεονεξίας,
soph. Ant. 848 ἄκλαυτος φίλων. Ι think these are best classed under
the head of ‘Genitive of the Sphere‚' an extension of the Inclusive
(‘ Partitive ’) genitive, ‘ untemptable in regard of evil things,' just
as it might be said of one who was wholly evil that he was
ἀπείραστος ἀγαθῶν.1 We have still to consider an objection drawn from
the context ε ‘there is no question here of God being tempted, but of
God tempting,' Alf. This is sufficiently met by the passages cited
above from Philo, Plutarch, and Antoninus: Grod is incapable of
tempting others to evil, because He is Himself absolutely unsusceptiblc

¹ Von Soden dcstroys the. sense of the passage by taking κακῶν of afflictione 11 is
of course used of moral evil, as in Rom. i. 30, 1 Cor. X. 6.
