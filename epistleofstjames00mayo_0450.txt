written Gospel. It was an oral revelation, passed from mouth to
mouth. The words of eternal life spoken by Christ were reported by
those who heard him, and these words were spirit and life to all who
received them. But even then it made no difference whether they
were addressed to many at once in the temple, as by Peter, or to one in
a chal-iot, as by Philip. Nor did it make any difference, when James
set the example of preaching by letter, where he could not preach in
person, and was followed by Paul and the other Apostles. Preaching
is only one out of niany Christianizing influences now at work in
England. some go so far as to question whether it would not be for
the advantage of all, preat-hers and hearers alike‚ if we would give
heed to St. ‹Jamee’ advice (μὴ πολλοὶ διδάσκαλοι γίνεσθε) and put a stop
to four-fifths of the preaching which now goes on. Still there is
room for sermons in the adaptation of the Gospel to the varying needs
of successive generations, and different classes of men, as well as to
the idiosyncrasies of different individuals. *And there is need of
course for personal influence, especially with the less educated. Next
to the influence of believing parents, and in some cases superior to
it, is the influence of a schoolmaster like Arnold, of a preacher like
Maurice or Keble, in convineing a man of the reality of Christianity.
