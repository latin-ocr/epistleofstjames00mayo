V 14, 15 NorEs ’ 161

It is Curious that there is no note on this verse in Theophylact,
Euth. Zig.‚ or Oramer’s Catena. Oecumenius on ἀλείψαντες ἐλαίῳ
refers simply to the miracles in the Gospels without alluding to any
sacramenta] use of 011 in his own day: τοῦτο καὶ τοῦ Κυρίου ἔτι τοῖς
ἀνθρώποις συναναστρεφομένου οἱ ἀπόστολοι ἐποίουν ἀλείφοντες τοὺς ἀσθε-
νοῦντας ἐλαίῳ καὶ ἰώμενοι. Bede in like manner speaks only of the use „
of oil for healing bodily disease: lioc et apostolos fecisse in Evanyelio
leyionus, et nunc Ecclesiae consuetudo tenet ut infirmi oleo consecrato
uviqantur a presbyteris et oratione comitante scinentnr. Nec solum pres-
byteris, secl, ut Innocentius papa scribit, etiam omnibus Christianis uti
licet eodem, oleo in sua coiit snorum necessitate ungzemlo, quocl tamen oleum
non nisi ab episcopis licet confici. Nam qnod ait, ‘ Oleo in nomine
Domini,' siqnisicat oleum consecratum in nomine Domini: vel certe qnia
etiam, cuin unynnt infirmum, nomen Domini super eum invocare debent.
Luther’s opponent, Cardinal Oajetan, in his comment on this verse
denies that it has any reference to the Sacrament of Extreme Unction t
Textus non dicit ‘ Infirmatnr quis acl mortem? sed absolute ‘Infirmatur
quis?' et effectum elicit infirmis alleviationem, et de remissione pecca-
torum non nisi conditionaliter loquitur. . . . Praeter hoc quod „Iacobus acl
urnmn aeorum multos presbyteros tum orantes tum uocyentes mandat
vocari, quocl ab extrema unctione alienum est.

ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου] In v. 10 we had the same phrase used of
the prophets only with the omission of the article before K. It is
probable however that the words τ. K., which are bracketed by WH‚,
are merely an explanatory gloss, as they are not found in B and are
variously given in the other MSS. In that case τὸ ὄνομα will be used
here as in 3 John 7 (where see Westcott), Acts v. 41 (where αὐτοῦ or
some other specifying genitive is added in the inferior MSS), Lev.
xxiv. 11, cf. above ii. 7, and the similar use of ἡ ὁδός 111 Acts ix. 2,
Χ1Χ. 9, &ol All cures were wrought in the name of J esus Christ3 cf.
Mark XVi. 17 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου...ε’πὶ ἀρρώστους χεῖρας ἐπιθήσουσιν,
Luke x. 17, John xiv. 13, Acts iii. 6, 16, iv. 10, xvi. 18, xix. 13 (of
the exorcists).

15. ἠ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως.] Prayer proceeding from saith, cf. i. 6.

σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα] ‘Shall restore to health him who is ailing,' cf.
Mark v. 23 (lay thy hands upon her) ὅπως σωθῇ καὶ ζήσεται, ib. vi. 56,
iii. 4, viii. 35, (hc. z so in Classical writers, Lys. p. 107 Ἀνδοκίδης ἕχει τὰ
μήνυτρα σώσας τὴν αὑτοῦ ψυχὴν ἑτέρων διὰ ταῦτα ἀποθανόντων; hence the
word σῶστρον was used of a doctor’s fee. This is the only passage in
the Ν .Τ. in which κάμνω is found in this sense, though it is common
enough in classical writers, who also use the aor. and perf. participles
of the dead. I see no ground for the distinction made by some
between ἀσθενῶ and κάμνω.

ἐγερεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ Κύριος] Cf. Mark i. 31 προσελθὼν ἤγειρεν αὐτήν, Matt.
ix. 5, Psa. xli. 8-10. Dean Plumptre compares Acts ix. 34 ‘J. C.
maketh thee whole.' The Re. interpreters understand it of spiritual

comfort.
1 Compare Clem. R. ii. 13 ἵνα τὸ ὄνομα μὴ βλασφημῆται, where Lightfoot refers

to his note on Ignat. Epa. 3, also Taylor, chz'slz Fathcrs, p. 81.
