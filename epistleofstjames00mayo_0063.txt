he turned round and knelt down saying ‘O Lord God my Father, I beseech
thee, forgive them, for they know not what they (10.ἲ While they were thus
stoning him one of the priests of the sons of Rechab, of whom J eremiah the
prophet testifies, cried out ‘Stop ! What do ye 2 The Just is praying for you!
And one of them who was a fuller smote the head of the rJust one with his
club. And so he bore his witness. And they buried him on the spot, and
his pillar still remains by the side of the Temple (with the inscription>,¹ ‘ He
hath been a true witness both to Jews and Greeks that Jesus is the Chris1.’
And immediately Vespasian eommenced the siege.

The brief account given by Josephus (Ant. Jud. xx, 9. 1) os the
death of James exhibits some important divergences from that of
Hegesippus.

During the interval between the death of Festus (probably in the year 62 Aecount os
A.D.) and the arrival of his successor Albinus, the high priest Ananus the his death hy
younger, being of rash and daring spirit and inclined like the Sadducees in ,Iosephus
general to extreme severity in punishing, brought to trial ‚J ames, the brother
of ‹Iesus who is called the Christ, and some others before the court of the
Sanhedrin, and having charged thern with breaking the laws, delivered them
over to be stoned. Josephus adds that the better class of citizens and
those who were versed in the laws were indignant at this and made complaints
both to King Agrippa and to Albinus, on the ground that Ananus had no right
to summon the Sanhedrin without the consent of the procurator; and that
Agrippa in consequence removed him from the high priesthood.2

Origen (Cels. i. p. 35 Spencer) and Eusebius (HE. ii. 23> also cite Josephus
as ascribing the miseries of the siege to the divine vengeance for the murder of
J ames the Just ; but this does not occur in his extant writingS.

Bishop Lightfoot's comments on the preceding (lc. pp. 366 and

330) are worth quoting.3 Of the account given by Josephus he {gffiligtts
says: ‘It is probable in itself, which the account in Hegesippus is pcncgllffissg

not, and is such as Josephus might be expected to write, if he
touched on the matter at all. His stolid silence about Christianity

¹ This seems the force of the Greek ἔτι αὐτοῦ ἡ στήλη μένει παρὰ τῷ ναῷ· μάρτυς
οὗτος ἀληθὴς Ἰουδαίοις τε καὶ ’Ἕλλησιν οὗτος γεγένηται κ.τ.λ. VVieseler in the JB. f.
deutsche Theoloyz‘e 1878, pp. 99 fell„ understands στήλη of a cenotaph, consisting of
a broken pillar with inscription, erected by later Christians close to ‘the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus, which was built by Hadrian on the site of the Jewish Temple.
Jerome (Da Vir. Ill. 2) renders στήλη by titulus.

2 Schiirer (Jewish Peoplc, vol. ii. p. 186 foll. Eng. Tr.) gives what to me appears
a very singular reason for rejecting this date. The passage, he says, has probably
suffered from Christian interpolation, since Origen read it differently from our text,
as agreeing with Hegesippus in bringing the death of James into close relation with
the fall of Jerusalem. But if there were such interpolation, its object must surely
have been to magnify the importance of James’ niartyrdom and make it the im-
mediate cause of God’s anger shown in the destruction of the guilty city. It is
plain therefore that :he inconsistent date (62 A.D.) cannot have formed a part of
the interpolation. Jerome Le. says that Clem. AL, in his Hypot. bk. vii„ gave the
same date as Josephus. In Ant. xx. 9. 6 Josephus assigns a. different cause sor the
fall of Jerusalem, viz. the presuniption of the Levites in wearing the dress of the -
priests. Σεὲ „2 i
