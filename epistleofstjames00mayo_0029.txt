tone of our Epistle and may help to explain the reservo with which
distinctivve Christian doctrines are treated in it. Is it going too far
to compare the use of ἁνγνίζω 111 Acts xxi. 24 and «1311193 iv. 8, 1111(1

αὐτοῖς) and in James iV. 3 ἵνα ἐν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν δαπανήσητε 2

The only other passage in which James is mentioned by 1131119 mmmm
’111 the Epistles is 1 Cor. XV. 7, where we are told that Jesus 1111111113
appeared to James after his Resurrection. Of this more will be 1111111111
said shortly. But we have seen that in Gal. i. 19 119 receives 1119
appellation of ‘ the Lord's brother‚' and there are further allusions
to the ‘brethren of the Lord' in 1 Cor. ix. 5, which is generally
taken to imply that they were all married, and in Acts i. 14, where
we are told that after the Ascension ‘the Eleven with the women
and Mary the mother of J esus and his brethren remained togetl‘ier

names of the brothers J ames and J ude. If they were really
brothers of the Lord, would they not have laid stress on the
authority derived from this relationship‚ just as St. Paul lays stress
on his apostleship? But what was Christ’s own teaching on 1119
matter? When his mother and brothers sought on one occasion
to 1139 the authority, which they assumed that their kinship gave
them, they were met by tho words ‘ who is my mother, and who
are my brethren ἓ ’ And he stretched out his hand to his disciples
and said ‘ Behold my mother and my brethren.' St. Paul expresses
the same idea, of the disappearance of the earthly relationship in
the higher spiritual union, by which all the members of the body
are joined to the Head, in the words ‘though we have known
Christ after the flesh, yet now know we him so no more‚’ ⁶2 Cor. v.
16. Surely it is only what we should have expected beforehand,
that James and Jude would shrink from claiming another 11111119
than that of ‘ servant ’ to express the relation in which they stood

to their risen Lord, after having failed (as I shall shortly endeavou r -

to show) to acknowledge Him as their Master in the days of his

humiliation.
