and I. 90 nec vero intelleyo cuo· maluerit Epicurus deos hominum similes
dicere quam homines deorum. Though the Divine image is traceable in
every child of man (as Bengel says, remanet nobilitas indelebilis), yet
it 16 only perfect in the Second Adam (Heb. i. 3, Col. i. 15, 2 Cor. iv.
4), into whose image the believer is being gradually transformed (Col.
iii. 10, Eph. iv. 24, 2 Cor. iii. 18). For the argument here cf. Gen. ix.

bination of blessing aud cursing which is condemned, and that either
may be allowable by itself. Can this be the meaning of St. James‘e
What was the general feelingvof the Jews about cui-sing? The old law
required the Israelite to curse on Mount Ebal and ble‘ss on Mount
Gerizim. The fact too that cursing was forbidden in special cases,
as against parents (Exod. xxi. 17), the king (ib. xxii. 28), the deaf (Lev.
xix. 14), seems to show that it was not generally condemned under the
old dispensation. It is referred to without implying blame, Prov. xi.
26, xxiv. 24, xxvi. 2, xxx. 10, Ε66166. vii. 21, x. 90. Compare also the
curse of Canaan by Noah (Gen. ix. 25), that of Simeon and Levi by
their father (Gen. xlix. 7), of the builder of Jericho by Joshua (Josh.
vi. 26), Abimelech by Jotharn (Jud. ix. 20, 57), Meroz by Deborah (ib.
v. 23), the children by Elisha (2 Κ. ii. 24), apostate Jews by Nehemiah
(Neh. xiii. 25), and the imprecations in the Psalms. Are we then
to suppose that St. -James here attaches a special force to the words
καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν Θεοῦ γεγονότας-1 Doos he mean by this, ‘men transformed ,
into the divine image ’2 This 6661116 precluded by a comparison of the
passages cited at the end of the preceding note, in which a similar
inference is drawn from man’s general relation to the Creator. Must
we then conclude that cursing in itself 16 here condemned as a
