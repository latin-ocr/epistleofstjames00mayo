cxiv THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

killing innocent, men, themselves the slaves of lust and luxury,
fattening themselves in the day of slaughter (ii. 6, 7, V. 3—6).
ΤΙιο Church is under the superintendence of Elders, who, or some
of whom, are possessed of miraculous gifts of healing, St. James
gives instructions as to the use of this gift (v. 14,15). Their
place of meeting is the synagogue, to which strangers are admitted
(ii. 2—4). They are exposed to trials of many kinds, especially
from their rich oppressors, and it is one main object of the Epistle
to encourage them to patient endurance (i. 2, 12, ii. 6, v. 7, ὅ, 10,
11). There is much however to blame in themselves : their saith
is very weak; they are inclined to murmur and coinplain both
against God and against man (i. 6—8, 13, iv. 11, ν. 9); their re-
ligion and their philanthropy alike are a matter of words and
forms, without corresponding feelings and actions (i. 22, 25—27, ii.
14—26>; they are deficient in genuine love of man as man}
they are haughty to the poor, obsequious to the rich (ii. 1-9‚
15, 113). They are censorious, quarmlsome, given to oaths‚ aln-
bitious, sels-confident, eager to set themselves up as teaehers,
greedy of pleasure, forgetful of God (iii. 1, 6, 9, 14, iv, 1—8‚ 13,
16, V. 12).

How far do these characteristics agree with what we read else-
’ where? First, as to the rich oppressors: I have pointed out, in
my note on ii. 6, that these were in all probability Jews The
Gentiles for a long time took no interest in the internal disputes
of Jewish sects: they might punish the Christian inissionaries
as disturbers of the public peace, but they were very un-
likely ‘ to blaspheme Christ ' themselves (James ii. 7). Again, if
they were Gentiles, why should the rich, rather than the poor,
take the trouble to persecute such an insignifieant body? In
Ephesus and Philippi, it is the rabble who make the loudest out-
cry against the Christians. On the other hand, if we turn to the
Jews, we find that the rich were as a fact the leaders in the
perseeutionS. It was the party of the high priest, the wealthy
