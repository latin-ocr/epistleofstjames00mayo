THE AUTHOR ⁴xiii

abomination and falsehood; saith is not included in tho works of
the law, but is contrasted with them as a different kind of
justification. Accordingly, St. -James need not be included in the
preceding Apostles. Much in the same way we find πλήν used,
where we should rather have expected ἀλλά, ey. Acts xxvii. 22,
ἀποβολὴ Ι’γὰρ ψυχῆς οὐδεμία ἔσται ἐξ ὑμῶν πλὴν τοῦ πλοίου.
But even if we give its usual force to εἰ μή, it will not follow that
St. James was included in the Twelve, for there can be no doubt
that in Gal. i. 12) ἕτερον looks backward to Κηφᾶν, not forward
to Ἰάκωβον. The sentence would have been complete at εἶδον,
‘I saw Peter and none other of the Apostles.' Then it strikes
St. Paul, as an afterthought, that the position of 5 ames, as Presi-
dent of the Church at Jerusalem, was not inferior to that of the
Apostles, and he adds ‘unless you reckon J aines among thenis
That the term ‘apostle' was not strictly confined 10 1116
Twelve appears from another passage in which -James is men-

tioned, 1 Cor. xv. 4—7. Here it is said that 563113 after his ιε we

resurrection ‘appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve, then to
above 500 brethren at once, then to James, then to all the
Apostles,’ where we should perhaps consider the term to include
the Seventy, according to the view of Irenaeus and other early
writers. At any rate there can be no doubt as to St. Paul's
apostleship. Barnabas also is called an apostle (Acts xiv. 4, 14),
probably also Andronicus and Junias (Rom. xvi. 7), and Silvanus
(l Thess. ii. 6).¹

It seems to me that the most natural interpretation of the two
passages just dealt with is that which concedes the name ‘apostle '
in the wider sense to St. JameS, but makes a distinction between
him and the Twelve. We should infer the same from 1 Cor. ix. 5, 6,
‘have we not a right to take about a wife that is a believer'
(ἀδελφὴν Ύυναῖκα) ὡς καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπόστολοι καὶ οἶ ἀδελφοὶ
τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ Κηφᾶς; ἢ μόνος ἐγὼ καὶ Βαρνάβας οὐκ ἔχομεν
ἐξουσίαν μὴ ἐργάζεσθαι ; Here οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπόστολοι 13 contrasted
with ’ἐγὼ καὶ Βαρνιὶβαςῑ and apparently the ‘brethren of the
Lord' and ‘Cephas' are particularized as being those who were
known to make use of the liberty belonging of right to all.

If it should be argued that, where the ‘brethren of the Lord'

are distinguished from the Twelve, this may be spoken loosely of
