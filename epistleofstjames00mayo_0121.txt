RELATION ΤΟ OTHER BOOKs OF THE N.T. xcvii

where the crown of life' becomes ‘the crown of glory which fadeth
ἵ not away'; James iv. 10 with 1 Pet. v, 6, where ‘Humble your—
selves in the sight of God and he shall exalt you ’ becomes
‘Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may
exalt- you in due time.' In the immediate context the simple
‘Resist the devil' of J ames, becomes ‘ Your adversary the devil as
a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour3 whom
resist steadfast in the saith ' in Peter. The most important
changes are those in which the tone of the N ew Testament is sub-
stituted for that of the Old, as in 1 Pet. ii. 21, where Christ is set
before us as our example of patient suffering, in contrast with
James v. 10, where the example of the prophets is appealed to.
Perhaps under this head may be mentioned the change from στηρί-
ξατε τὰς καρδίας, in James V. 9, to ὁ Θεὸς αὐτὸς στηρίξει 111 1 Pet.
v. 1Ο; and the employment of the emphatic πρὸ πάντων to enforce
the exhortation to brotherly love in 1 Pet. iv, 8, instead of the
exhortation to abstain from swearing in J ames v. 12.

There is a curious difference between the use made of quotations
from the Old Testament in the two Epistles. St.Ja1nes seldom
quotes exactly. We can see by his phraseology that he has some
passage of the Old Testament in his mind, but he uses it freely
to colour his language‚ applying it to his own immediate purpose
without any scrupulous reference to its original context. It is this
’ laxity of quotation which causes the difficulty in J ames iv. 4-(5 and
presents what is probably an ‘unwritten word' of Christ under
two forms in i. 12 and ii. 5. If we turn to the quotations which
are common to him and to St. Peter, we often find the inexact and
careless reminiscences of the former corrected and supplemented
in the latter. Thus there can be little doubt that when st. J ames
used ‘the phrase δοκίμιον πίστεως he had in his mind Prov. xxvii.
21 δοκίμιον ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσῷ πύρωσις, (ἰνὴρ δὲ δοκιμάζεται
διὰ, στόματος ἐγκωμιαζόντων αὐτόν, and Prov. xvii. 3, which is
nearer in meaning though less closely allied in expression, ὥσπερ
δοκιμάζεται ἐν καμίνῳ ἄργυρος καὶ χρυσός, οὕτως ἐκλεκταὶ καρ-
δίαι παρὰ Κυρίῳ, and accordingly we find St. Peter supplying
these words (δοκίμιον) πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου
διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου. Another quotation appears in J ames
i. 10, 11 (let the rich man boast in his humiliation) ὅτι coc c'x'rveoc
