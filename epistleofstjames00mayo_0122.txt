xcviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. J AMES

ἐξήρανεν τὸν χόρτον καὶ τὸ &neoc αὐτοῦ ὲΞέΠεσεΝ καὶὴ
εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο· οὕτως καὶ ὁ πλούσιος
ἐν ταῖς πορείαις αὑτοῦ μαρανθήσεται. This is evidently taken
mainly from Isa. xl. 6, 7, where the perishing nature of man is
contrasted with the imperishableness of God’s Word. St. James,
it will be seen, confines himself to the former branch of the com-
parison, limiting it indeed to the case of the rich man, and makes
no mention here of the Word. But in 1 Pet. i. 23 the new life
communicated by the living and abiding VVord of G0d‚ which St.
J ames treats of in another part of his Epistle‚ is the subject of the
discourse (ἀναγεγεννημένοι...διὰ λόνγου ζῶντος Θεοῦ καὶ μένοντος);
this is then proved by the quotation, given almost literally from
Isaiah, as follows: διότι Πᾶσᾼ σὰρξ ὡς χόρτος xcxi nasa ΔόΞΑ αὐτῆς
ὡς &neoc χόρτογ· ἐΞΗροἏΝΘΗ ὁ χόρτος καὶ τὸ &neoc ὲΞὲΠεσεΝ· τὸ Δὲ
pumex Κυρίου Mene! cic τόΝ amma, the only changes being the in·
sertion of the first ὡς, the substitution of αὐτῆς for ᾹΝθρώῑ-[ογ and
of Κυρίου for τοῨ ΘεοῨ ἡΜώΝ, In the passage of St. James we
observe the intermingling of another quotation from the Book of
Jonah iv. 8 ε’νγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνατεῖλαι τὸν ἥλιον καὶ
προσέταξεν ὁ Θεὸς πνεύματι καύσωνι.

In the difficult passage James iv, 4-(5 (‘ whosoever would be a
friend of the world becomes thereby an enemy of God. Or think
ye that the Scripture saith without meaning, J ealously yearneth the
Spirit which he hath implanted in you? But he giveth more
grace: wherefore he saith ') ὁ Θεὸς ὑπερηφάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται τα-
πεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν, the concluding Greek words are exactly
the same as in 1 Pet. v. 5, being taken literally from the LXX. of
Prov. iii. 34, except that this latter has Κύριος for ὁ Θεός. The
context however in which they occur differs much in the two
Epistles. St. Peter uses them to enforce the duty of humility in
our intercourse with our fellow-men‚ ‘ Ye younger be subject unto
the elder: yea all of you gird yourselves with humility for aod
‘rrsz'stellz the proua’, bat {sivetlc yram* to the lmmblc,' which is probably
the original application in thc Proverbs3 but St. J ames, as we have
seen, sccms to make ⁴ the proud '⁴ equivalent to ‘thc friends of the
world‚' and the ‘huinblc' to be those who submit themselves to
God.

The last quotation is that from the Hebrew (not the LXX.) of
Prox'. x. 12 ‘Hatred stirreth up strife, but loz-c comem all sins}
