exactly reversed the truth, and that the order of thought is much
more logical here than in St. Peter. All falls naturally under 1111.-
heading ‘ loyalty to God.' The word ‘humility ' is used through-
out in reference to our attitude towards God. Quarrels arise fron]
an unchastened desire for worldly good. We cannot have peace
either in ourselves or with our neighbours until we submit
ourselves unreservedly to God, who resists those that aim at
worldly success and make a god of sels, but gives grace to those
that surrender up their wills to His. Hc who teinpted Eve, tempts
us also to set up our will against God's will ; but, if we refuso to
listen‚ the temptor flies3 while any attempt on our part to draw
near to God brings Him near to us. The meaning of ‘ exaltation‚’
ὑψώσει, in the lOth verse is explained by τῷ ὕψει in i. 9. It
refers to no outward pmsperity, but to the moral dignity which
belongs to him who has made God his portion.

Briickner refers, as Ι have done, to the common quotations con-
tained in the two Epistles, Ι pointed out that it was characteristic
of St. James to quote carelessly, of St. Peter to quote accurately3
that the former uses a biblical phrase without reference to its
original context, while the latter holds fast to the original context.
To me this seeined to favour the supposition that St. Peter was the
copyist. BrUckner takes the reverse view. I leave it to each
man’s common-sense to say which is right, after he has compared
the contexts of the quotations in the two Epistles.

His next point is that τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα in J ames ii. 7 1135 to bc
explained from 1 Pet. iv. 14—16 εἰ ὀνειδίζεσθε ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ
μακάριοι...εἰ δὲ ὡς Χριστιανὸς (πάσχει), μὴ αἰσχυνέσθω, δοξαζέτω
δὲ τὸν Θεὸν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ. This is a similar case to the
preceding. In my view it exhibits St. Peter, as usual, filling up the
bare outline of St. J ames. That the phrase needs no explanation
is plain from the parallel passages quoted in my notes ι’1ι loco and
on v. 14 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι.

Lastly he thinks that the πρὸ πάντων of ‹Jalnes v. 12 has been
transferred from its more appropriate context in 1 Pet. iv, ὅ. Ι11
my note on V. 12 I have pointed out that πρὸ πάντων must bc
understood in reference to other manifestations of an impatient
spirit, and not as exalting the abstaining from oaths above all
other Christian duties. Probably it was a common phrase with
the writer. If it was suggested, as I believe, to St. Peter by his
