THE AUTHOR xi

αὐτοῦ. It will hardly be said that they are included in the
Twelve, as Mary among the women, and specially mentioned
afterwards, as she is, only on account of their superior importance.
If so, they would have been mentioned immediately after the
Apostles; on the contrary they are placed after Mary, being
joined with her, as in several other passages, because they, with
her, constit-ute the family to which Jesus belonged. Thus in
‚John ii. 12 we read that Jesus went down to Capernaum αὐτὸς
καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐκεῖ
ἔμειναν οὐ πολλὰς ἡμέραςε in Matt. xii. 47 foll. ‘One said to him '
ἰδοὺ ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἔξω ἑστήκασιν ζητοῦντές σοι
λαλῆσαι . . . . ‘and stretching forth his hand to his disciples he
saith’ ἰδοὺ ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου· ὅστις Γγὰρ ἂν ποιήσῃ
τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Πατρός μου, τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς, αὐτός μοι ἀδελφὸς καὶ
ἀδελφὴ καὶ μήτηρ ἐστίν. In the last passage there is the same
strong antithesis between natural earthly ties and his duty to his
Father in heaven, which we observe in the words spoken by him
when found as a boy in the Temple.

Notice also that there is in this passage not only a distinction
made between the brethren of Jesus and his disciples, but a
certain opposition is implied, which is brought out more clearly
in St. Mark's narrative of the same event (iii. 21, 31—35).
From the latter it appears that the reason why they of his
family (οἱ παρ’ αὐτοῦ) desired to speak with him was because the
rumour which had reached them of his incessant labours led them
to believe that he was out of his mind. As St. Mark goes on to
say (ver. 22) that the scribes accused Jesus of (tasting out devils
through Beelzebub, and as we further read in John (x. 20, viii.
48) that many said ‘He hath a devil and is mad '3 it would seem,
though it is not expressly stated, that these calumnious reports of
his enemies had not been without effect on some members of
his own family. At all events, they went out prepared κρατεῖν
αὐτόν, w. to put him under some restraint. This narrative gives
additional point to the words in Mark vi. 4, spoken with immediate
reference to the unbelief of the people of Nazareth, οὐκ ἔστιν
προφήτης ἄτιμος εἰ μὴ ἐν τῇ πατρίδι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τοῖς συγγενεῦσιν
αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ. If it were simply the disbelief of
townspeople not immediately related to him, there seems no need
for the addition ‘in his own kinsfolk :ind in his own house)

On the con-
trary, we
read that His·

were not

believers.
