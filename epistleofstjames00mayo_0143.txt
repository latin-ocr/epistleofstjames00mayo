WE have scen in Chapter II. that the Epistle was recognized 1,Τ,“ 111ξο 5111

as canonical at the third Gouncil of Cvuthage (A.D. 397), that it?l 111111231οξ
was included m their lists of Sacled Writings by Athanasius 111 3673: 1111 111011, ’1101ῑ11ᾓ
and by Cyril of Jfflusalem in 348, that it is quoted by name as (01110151 11111 ξξῐ1ῐ101ῑ1·

authoritative by Eusebius 1n his Oommcntam 3] οη tlte Psalms (c. 330) {0„.1‚0.f1{}011
and by Origen (c. 230) and is by both attributed, though with a ‘'f-§¹¹11
certain degree of hesitation, to James, the brother of the Lord;
that it is referred to anonymously by Irenaeus, Theophilus,
Justin Martyr‚ the writer of the Epistle to Diognetus, Ignatius,
Polycarp, Clernent of Alexandria and others, but above all by
Hermas during the second century3 by Cleinent of Rome, and
the author of the Didache during the lst century, also by
Barnabas, and the author of the Testaments of the Twelve
Patriarchs‚ who are commonly assigned to the same century. We
have seen in Chapter I. that the contents of the Epistle are
entirely in harmony with the supposition that it was written by
James the brother of the Lord, who was martyred in the year 63
according to J osephus, in 68 according to Hegesippus. It agrees
in character with all that we read of J ames in the Epistles of St.
Paul and in the Acts of the Apostles3 it agrees in style and diction
with the speeches and letter of J aines lit-erally recorded in the latter
book. In Chapter IV. we have seen that it is quoted by several
of the writers of the N. T„ notably by St. Peter and by St. Paul 3
by the latter certainly in his Epistle to the Romans written in 58,
probably in his two Epistles to the Corinthians (57) and possibly

in his first Epist-le to the Thessalonians (52).

¹ 1t1s not my aim here, any mom than in othe 1 chapteis, to put forward an
independent scheme of chronology of my own3 but, assuming the general correctness
of the usually accepted chronology, I have endeavoured to determine, with reference
to it, the date of the Epistle, supposed to be previously unknown.
