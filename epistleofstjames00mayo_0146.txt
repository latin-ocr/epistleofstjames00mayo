cxxii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

or to control the exercise of such powers on the part of others:
they are to pray for the sick and apparently to hear their confession
(v, 14, 15); but this does not imply any distinctive spiritual
authority, for in the next verse the injunction is made general,
‘ Conse-ss your sins to one another and pray for one another.' It is
interesting to compare the parallel passage in 1 Pet. V. 1-5.
There the elders hold a much more important position: they are
fellow elders of the Apostle himself, shephcrds of the [lock of God,
who shall receive their reward from the chief Shepherd on his
appearance: the younger are to be subject to them. But then
follows, as in St. James, the extension of this injunction to all,
including the clders themselves 3 πάντες δὲ ἀλλήλοις τὴν ταπεινο-
φροσύνην ἐγκομβώσασθε, ‘ yca, all of you gird yourselvcs (cf. J oh.
xiii. 4) with humility towards one another.' Further the means
enjoined by St. Jallles for the miraculous healing take us back to
the earliest age of the Chulcb. The only other reference in the
New Testament to the use of oil for the sick, is in St. Mark's
account of the mission of the Twelve, ‘ They anointed with oil many

No less confirmatory of an early (late is the Judaic tone

promulgated by Christ cannot be made in a moment, even
where the old religion is as corrupt and irrational as modern
Hinduism; far less where there is so much to satisfy the claims
of the reason and conscience, as in the law of Moses. That law
was intended as a schoolmaster to bring men to Christ. These
who had been duly prepared by it and ‘were waiting for the
consolation of Israel ' were able at once to welcome J esus as the
expected Mcssiah, to accept his spiritualization of the Law given
on Sinai, and acknowledge their own inability to fulfil the new law
of liberty except through the promised help of the Holy Spirit.
The sermons reported in the Acts scarcely go beyond this. A
few perhaps would be able to make a further advance, and confess
the Divinity of Christ and the atonement wrought by th for the
sins of the whole world, but the majority of Jewish Christians
between the day of Pentecost and the fall of Jerusalem were
probably even less advanced. They did not understand that the
former things had passed away, and that from henceforth neither
