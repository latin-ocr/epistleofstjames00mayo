THE AUTHOR xxv

present purpose it seems desirable to separate our consideration of
these from our consideration of tradition, as embodying an actual
recollection of fact handed down orally from father to son, or
crystallized in literature at a certain stage of its progress. There
is also such a thing as manufactured tradition, like that of the
Ciceroni, or merely literary tradition, like that which has grown
up round the soenes of many of Scott’s romances. In our investi-
gation of any so-called tradition it is of the utmost importance to
be on our guard against inistaking deliberate invention of this kind
for natural grow th.
If we go back to the fourth century we find Jerome, the Jerfflnean‘l

author of the now dominant theory, throwing scorn on the 0ὗὲῗίῃεῖἶέἧο

tradition of his day, and taunting those who considered the ’Ξῖῗξέἐὲῑοῗιῐ
Lord's brethren to be the sons of Joseph by a former wife, as inltsheiil <igi-s
‘ following the ravings of the apocrypha] writings, and inventing a tovssssfigfry-
certain Melcha or Escha <for Joseph's first wife).’1 Origen too mlmgs‘
(d. 253), who holds the view derided by Jerome, quotes as his
authority for it the apocryphal Gospel according to Peter, written

before the middle of the second century (D. οἵ Chr. Βίῳ. ii. p. 712),

and the Protevcmyolium Jacobz‘ written about the same time (Light-

foot Le. p. 275) : ‘He had no natural brothers, seeing that neither

was any other child born to the Virgin, nor was he himself sprung

from J oseph3 accordingly (those mentioned) were his brothers only

in a conventional sense, being sons of Joseph by a pre-deceased wife.' ’2

‘ Some persons on the ground of tradition, viz„ the Gospel according

to Peter or the Book of J ames, say that the brothers of J esus were

Joseph's sons by a former wife to whom he was married before

Mary. Those who hold this view wish to preserve the honour of

Mary in virginity throughout, in order that her body chosen for so

high a purpose might not be degraded to lower use after the Holy

Spirit had once come upon her. . . . And Ι think it reasonable that

as -Jesus was the first-fruit of purity and chastity among rnen, so

Mary should be among women.' 3
