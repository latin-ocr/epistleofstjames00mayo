ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF ST. JAMES clxxxvii

ἥκουσιν ὥστε διεμαρτύρουν τάναντία οἷς αὐτοὶ ἔπραξαν, οἵτινες

ἀπέγραψαν αὐτοὺς κ.τ.λ., Xen. Ayes. i. 36 ἄξιον ἄνγασθαι αὐτοῦ,

ὅστις ὑπ’ οὐδενὸς ἐκρατήθη, Ellendt, Lem. Soph. sy. ii. 3. The

only unclassical use is the modified Hellenistic emphasis on αὐτοὶ

111 ii. 7 = ‘ is it not they who ’ἲ We do not find St.. Luke's αὐτὸς

ὁ for ὁ αὐτός, nor ὅς 1101· ποῖος for τίς, as seems to be the case in

Matt. xxvi. 50, xxiv. 43, Acts xxiii. 34. Ι
None of the exalnples mentioned under Nambor (mal Gcndm· are gs

contrary to classical usage, while some are idiomatic, eg. ἅνγε νῦν with Ι

plural verb, a use of ἄνγε which is not found elsewhere in the N.T.

Censes—The use of the Noni. in apposition to an oblique case .,'
(iii. 8 τὴν νγλῶσσαν...μεστὴ ἰοῦ) is certainly harsh, but admits of Ι
some explanation, which distinguishes it fron] the solecisms quoted
in the note from St. Mark and the Apocalypse.

Perhaps the point in which our Epistle ‹leparts most from*v
Classical usage is in regard to the Genitive of Quality, such as
ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς i. 25, κριταὶ διαλοὙισμῶν πονηρῶν ii. 4⁴, ὁ 3
κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας 111. 6. Vorst explains this by the comparative Ἰ
paucity of adjectives in the Hebrew language (Helm. pp. 244. solt),
comparing Acts ix. 15 σκεῦος ἐκλονγῆς, Heb. i. f) ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς
εὐθύτητος, Hosea xii. 7 where the Heb. ‘balance of deceit⁷ is
expressed by ζυὙὸς ἀδικίας of the LXX„ but in Prov. xx. 23 by
ζυνγὸς δόλιος.

The only use of the Dative which seems to call for notice here ἒ
is the Hebraistic use of the cognate with intensive force in v. 17
προσευχῇ προσηύξατο. This is found in several books of the ᾗ
N. T. but apparently not in St. Paul’s writings.

Prcposz'ez'oozs.—Tlie constructions ὁ ἰὸς εἰς μαρτύριον ἔσται, and
ἐλονγίσθη εἰς δικαιοσύνην are Hebraistic and not found in classical
authors, though common in the N.T., see notes on ii. 23, V. 3.
The distinction between εἰς and ἐν is never lost in St. James, as it
is in some of the writers of the N.T.

ἐπίε used with acc, where we might have expected either tho ·‘
simple dat. 01· dat. with ἐπί, eg. iii. 7 after ἐπικαλεῖν (cf. 2 Chron.
vii. 14 ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου, Acts xiX. 13 ὀνομάζειν
ἐπὶ τοὺς ἔχοντας τὰ πνεύματα τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Κυρίου, but Plato
Tim. 60 ᾧ «γένει κέραμον ἐπωνομάκαμεν, Res). vi. 493 ὀνομάζειν
ταῦτα πάντα ἐπὶ ταῖς τοῦ μεγάλου ζῴου δόξαις, Stallb. on Bep.
