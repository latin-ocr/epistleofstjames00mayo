with what is

St. Paul says that three years after his conversion, probably about Sffllifglf'bj‘·

the year 38 A.D.‚ he. went from Damascus to Jerusalem and stayed and Actsof

Jarnes, the

with Peter fifteen days, seeing no other apostle but only J ames the ¹³{J,‘³s⁵³,‘},“g¹¹²
Lord's brother. This is quite in accordance with what we read in {335130‘35
the Acts xii. 17, where Peter, on his escape from prison (ΑΛ). 44), ’ '⁴ ¹
is recorded to have gone to the house of Mary the mother of Mark,

and desired that the news of his escape might hc sent to ‚James

and the brethren. In Gal. ii. 1-10 St. Paul describes a later visit to
Jerusalem after an interval of fourteen years, felc. about A.D. 51. ln

this visit the leaders of the Church‚ &unes Peter and John

(Isse. ver. 9), after bearing his report of his first missionary journey,
signified their approval of his work and ‘gave right hands 01
fellowship‚' agreeing that Paul and Barnabas should preach to the
Gentiles and they themselves to the circumcision. ln verses 11-14

of the same chapter Peter's inconsistency in regard to eating with

the Gentiles at Antioch is explained by the arrival of certain from

James, ’πρὸ τοῦ ’γὰρ ἐλθεῖν τινὰς ἀπὸ Ἰακώβου μετὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν
συνήσθιεν· ὅτε δὲ ἦλθον, ὑπέστελλεν καὶ ἀφώριζεν ἑαυτὸν φοβού-

μενος τοὺς ἐκ περιτομῆς. Τ1113 second visit is more fully described

in Acts xv. 4-221 where James appears as President of the Council

held to consider-‘how far the Gentile Christians should be required

to conform to the customs of the Jews. It is -James who sums up

the discussion, and proposes the resolution which is carried, in the

words ἐγὼ κρίνω μὴ παρενοχλεῖν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐπιστρέφου-

σιν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν, κ.τ.λ.

It is important to notice that in 1113 speech (ver. 14) Peter Reum-lamo,

agreeinents

is called Symeon, a name never assigned to him elsewhere in between

our Epistie

the Acts or in any part of the Nss. except in 2 Pet. i. 1. s‘ss‘e'geiffif
From this we gather that the actual words of the speaker are Ὦξξζξῖῐ
recorded either in their original form or in a translation3 and Ἀ “
it becomes thus a matter of interest to learn whether there is
any resemblance between the language of our Epistle and that
of the speech said to have been uttered by Jatnes, and of the
circular containing the decree, which was probably drawn up by

him.1 I cannot but think it a remarkable coincidence that, out of
