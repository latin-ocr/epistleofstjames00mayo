the term ‘brothers in the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions
of the second century, and the Apostolic Constitutions of the third,1
and probably by Cyri] of Jerusalem.

Hegesippus (about 160) maintains‚ as we have seen, that J ames
and Jude were brothers of the Lord, and speaks of the sons of
Clopas, the brother of his reputed father Joseph, as his cousins,
making no mention of cousins on the mother's side.

Basil the Great (379), discussing the meaning of Matt. 120,
allows that the perpetual virginity is not a necessary article of
belief, yet adheres to it himself, ‘since the lovers of Christ cannot
endure to hear that the mother of God ceased to be a virgin.'²
He cites Matt. xxviii. 20 to show that ἕως need not imply any
change in the virgin's state. So πρωτότοκος may be used techni-
cally of him who opens the womb, though there may be no second
child. He then refers to the apocryphal story of Zacharias being
slain by the Jews because he had placed Mary in the rank of the
virgins after her conception.

On the other hand Tertullian (d. 2:20) argues against Marcion, Tlfrtpllian
who had made use of the text ‘Who is my mother, and who my mgsseesvffiic

¹ Ap. Const. iii. 6 ‘ There were with us (the Apostles) the mother of our Lord and
his sisters, also Mary Magdalene and the mother os James, and Martha and Mary
sisters of Lazarus, and Salome with other women’ [We gather from this that ‘the
sisters of the Lord were not the sisters of James the Little]; ib. vi. 12 ἡμεῖς οἱ
δώδεκα συνελθόντες εἷς Ἰερουσαλὴμ...ἐπεσκεπτόμεθα ἅμα Ἰακώβῳ τῷ τοῦ Κυρίου ἀδελφῷ
τί ’γένηται ; and even more distinctly in vi. 14 where after the names of the Twelve
are added Ἰάκωβός τε ὃ τοῦ Κυρίου ἀδελφὸς καὶ Ἰεροσολύμων ἐπίσκοπος, καὶ Παῦλος ὁ
τῶν ἐθνῶν διδάσκαλος; ih. viii. 35 ‘I James the brother of Christ according to the
flesh, but his servant as the only begotten God, and appointed bishop of Jerusalem
by the Lord Himself and the Apostles do ordain thus,’ &c. On the other hand the
constitution of James, son of Alphaeus, is given in viii. 23. So Euseb. in Isa. xvii.
