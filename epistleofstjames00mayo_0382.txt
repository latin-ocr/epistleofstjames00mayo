122 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

111.22.61ὅπου φθόνοι καὶ ζηλοτυπίαι, ποῦ ἐκεῖ πάροδος εὖὸαιμονίας,· ὅπου
δ’ ἂν ᾗ σαπρά δόγματα, ἐκεῖ πάντα Ταυτα Εἶναι ἀνάγκη.

17. ἡ δὲ ἄνωθεν σοφία] Compare Wisd. vii. 7—30 esp, vv. 25 and 26,
ib. ix. 10. ·

πρωτον μὲν ἁγνή] First the inn01·clia1··acte1istic‚ purity, then the
miter, peaceableness, cf. the blessing in.Mat›b. v. 8, 9. It is the pure
who attain to ‘ohe vision of God which constibutes the highest wisdom.
Matr. v. 8, Acts xv. 9, 2 Cor. vi 6, lTim. i. 4, Heb. x 22. We may
compare Antoninus viii. 5 συμμιημοιεισας τί τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἡ φισις
ἀπαιτεῖ, πρᾶξον ΤΟῦΤΟ (ὶμΕΤασΤρΕπΤί, Καὶ Εἰπὲ ὡς δίκαίΟΤαΤΟΙΙ φαίνεται O'OL,
μόνον Ευμενῶς Καῑ αιδημθνως Καὶ ἀνυπΟΚρίΤως-

ἔπειτα εἰρηνική] Τ110 omission of δέ aftei ἔπειτα is quite classic-al
(Winer p. 721), ef, below‘ iv. 14, John xi. 6: ἔπειτα δέ occurs in Heb.
vii. 2. For the ηεξ-0011111011 of truth (wisdom) and peace compare Rom.
viii. 6 τὸ φρόνημα τοῦ πνεύματος ζωὴ καὶ εἰρήνη, Ps. lxxxv. lO, Prov. iii.
17, Isa. xxxii. 17, ib. xxvi. 3 ἀντιλαβόμενος ἀληθείας καὶ φυλάσσων εἰρήνην,
Jer. xxxiii. 6, Mal. ii. 6. The word εἰρηνικός is only found elsewhere
in NT. in Heb. xii. 11.

ἑπιεικής.] Aristotle (Etle. vi. 11) says τὸν ἐπιεικῆ μάλιστα φαμὲν
συγγνωμονικόν, and (Eclc. V. 14) contrasts ἐπιείκεια ‘equity⁷ with strici)
justice, where Grant quotes the more detailed description given in
Rhea. i. 13. 17 foll. ε ‘ It is equity 1·,ο pardon human failings, and to
look to the law-givet· and not> to the law, to the spiri‘n and 1101, to the
letter, to ‘ohe intention and 1101) bo the action, to the whole and 1101, to
the Ρ 11·,1’, to the character of the 110101· 111 the long run and nob in ‘ohe
present> imment, to remembei good rather bhan evil, and good that one
has received 11111101· than good than 000 has done, to pub up with
injmious tieatment, to wish to settle a matter by w01ds rather than
deeds, lastly to prefer 111-0111111100 to judgmenb.' Cope in loc. renders it
‘ mei-eiful consideration! In Homer the adj. is used in opposition to
ἀεικής ( = seemly‚ decorous, fitting). It seems not. to be used of persons
before Herod. i. 85 (of the son of Croesus) τὰ μὲν ἀλλὰ ἐπιεικής, ἄφωνος δὲ
(10 other respects a goodly youth). Thucydides (viii. 93) uses it of men
who would lis-ten to reason3 in Cleon's speech (iii. 90> οἶκτος is joined
with ἐπιείκεια (like τὸ ἐπιεικὲς καὶ ξύγγνωμον Plato Leq. Vi. 757) as one of
‘che things most injurious to a ruling state, cf. ib. v. 86. Plato con-
stautly uses ib of respectable, well-behaved people, as opposed to those
who are rude and violent: in Jeep. 397 D one who had before been
called μέτριος is referred bo as ὃ ἐπιεικής, as in Thuc. i. 76 τὸ
ἐπιεικές = τὸ μετριάζειν ‘moderation ' 3 hence its colloquial use in
Plato and Aristotle = σπουδαῖος or ἀγαθός. In the N.T. it always
has the more special sense, and is twice joined with ἄμαχος (l Tim. iii.
3, Tit. iii. 2) : in 1 Pet. ii. 18 it is used of 11 master who is considerate
towards his slaves; Acts xxiv, 4 Tertullus begs Felix to hear him with
his usual condescension (ἐπιεικείᾳ) : bhe most, important passage is 2 Cor.
X. 1 παρακαλῶ ὑμᾶς διὰ τῆς πραΰτητος καὶ ἐπιεικείας τοῦ Χριστοῦ, Which
Matnhew Arnold rendered by his phrase of ‘sweeb reasonableness,'
compare Phil. iv. 5, Wisdon] ii. 19 ὕβρει καὶ βασάνῳ ἐτάσωμεν αὐτὸν (the
just) ἵνα γνῶμεν τὴν ἐπιείκειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ δοκιμάσωμεν τὴν ἀνεξικακίαν αὐτοῦ,
