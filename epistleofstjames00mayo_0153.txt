ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxix

The passage in St. Jamcs seems to imply an earlier condition of
things for he there enjoins mutual confession and prayer.

Dr. Davidson goes on to deny the authenticity of the Epistle
on the ground (1) that its polemio aspect towards the doctrine of
justification by saith alone, assigns it to a post—apostolic period.
[This argument has, of course, no weight with those who do not
recognize any polemic aspect towards St. Paul's doctrine. I
have shown, in ch. iv.² that St. James is attacking that most
ancient of all religious heresies‚ which puts words and professions
in the place of deeds and conduct] (2) ‘ The style of writing is too
good for J ames.’ Something has been said on this point already
in pp. xli. and xlii„ and more will be said shortly in the chapter
on the Language of the Epistle. (3) ‘ It is not likely that
J ames, the Lord's brother, would have directly opposed Paul's
doctrine...That he should have written against it argues a want of
respect for the Apostle of the Gentiles incompatible with J ames’s
position.' Quite true ; but of no force against those who deny the
polemic aspect. (4) ‘The essential doctrines of Christianity are.
wanting in the Epistle...Had 5 ames written it, we should naturally
expect some mention of Christ’s resurrection at least...On thc
other hand, the Mosaic law, circumcision, &c., are passed over, and
the royal law of liberty is exalted. ..The writer had therefore attained
to a subjective standpoint beyond James3 to ideas of Christian
liberty like the Pauline...Although the statement of Christian
doctrines is incomplete as well as imperfect, and the writer's point
of view more J ewish than Christian, he occupies a spiritual stage
in J ewish Christianity which J ames the Just scarcely reached.' It
might be well if the writer of these confused and sels-contradictory
sentences would take the trouble carefully to compare the teaching
of the Sermon on the Mount with that of St. 5 ames, and consider
how far his remarks are applicable to the former. (5) ‘ The letter
is professedly addressed to all J ewish-Christians out of Palestine.
But were there churches composed of such members 2...Churches
were of a mixed character except in Palestine. Wiesinger there-
fore may well ask, Where shall we look for the 5 ewish—Christians
out of Palestine which will satisfy the requirements of the Epistle 2—
a question not answered by reference to Acts ii. 5—11‚ xi. 19, &c.,
because the passages are far from implying the extensive establish-
ment of 5 ewish—Christian churches immediately after Pentecost.
