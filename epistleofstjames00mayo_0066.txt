xlii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

natives of Gadara, Philodemus the Epicurean, a friend of Cicero
and one of the poets of the Anthology, whose writings fill the larger
part of the Herculanean scrolls3 Theodorus, the instructor of
Tiberius in rhetori03 Meleager, the famous writer of epigrams and
collector of the first Greek Anthology3 and Menippus the Cyme,
whose (lialogues wereimitated by Varro and Luc-ian} The question
whether our Epistle was originally written in Greek will be con-
sidered further on ; but these eonsiderations may perhaps lead us to
the conclusion that it was not more impossible for a peasant of
Galilee to learn to write good Greek, than for one who had been
brought up as a Welsh peasant to learn to write good English, or
for a Breton to write good French ; far more likely, we might think,
than that a clover Hindoo should, as so many have done, make
himself familiar with the best English authors, and write a good
English style. Connected with this is the question, as to which
something will be said iu a future chapter, whether there are any
indications of acquaintance with Greek poets and philosophers on
the part of St. JameS, and possibly even of our Lord Himself.

,Ῐοξζζῃῗξῃά an unusual extent by our Lord, both in his preaching to the multi-
ΜΨ· tude, of which it is said ‘without a parable spake he not unto
them ' (Matt. xiii. 34), and even in his ordinary conversation, which
constantly ran into a parabolic or figurative form, to the great
bewilderment of his disciples, as when he bid them ‘beware of the

leaven of the Pharisees' (Matt. xvi. 6, cf. John xvi. 29, Luke viii.

'ssffissffixfgs 10). One distinctive feature of our Lord's use of parables is that
speech· there is nothing forced or artificial either in the figure or in the
application: natural phenomena and the varied circumstances of

human life are watchcd with an observant eye and a sympathetic

and leving imagination, and the spiritual analogies which they sug-

gest are seen to flow naturally from them. And we may bc sure

² uf. Neubauer in Studia, Biblica i. p. 52, ‘It is'stated in the 'Palmud that Gali-
lcans were wamlvring preachers, and excelled especially in the aggadic or homiletic
interpretation of the biblica] texts, which was often expresscd in tho form osa

parable.’ Hc refers to his Geoqraplzz'n du Talmud, p. 185.
