meaning all that is contained iu our life ¹ 3 the tongue being the axle,
the central lire from which the whole is kindled. This seems to make
the better sense, though the other meaning gives more precise point to
φλογίζουσα. Lucian's treatise De Calumnioe will illustrate how it is
that the tongue sets on fire ⁴ the round of life‚’ cf. 1 (through calumny)
καὶ οἶκοι ἀνάστατοι γεγόνασι καὶ πόλεις ἄρδην ἀπολώλασι, cf. Sirac. xxviii.

φλογιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς γεέννης] For the repetition of different parts
of the same verb see above i. 13 ἀπείραστος -πειράζει, and below v. 7
δαμάζεται-δεδάμασται. The name Gehenna (Γαιέννα) occurs only οηι-ι·
in LXX. (Josh. xviii. 16), more commonly it is denoted as φάραγξ
Έννόμ, see Wetsteiu i. p. 299, J). of B. under ‘ Gehenna ' ancl
· Tophet.' It is found in Matt. v, 22 τὴν γεένναν τοῦ πυρός (where see

ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου ἐστίν, κ.τ.λ. Here we have the origin
of sin carried back beyond the ἐπιθυμία of the individual man as shown
above i. 14. Thus we have combined in this passage the three hostile
principles, the world embodied in the tongue, the flesh in the members
(iv, 1 as well as here) and Satan using both for his own purpose.
VVetst. quotes from the 'sai-gum 011 Ps. cxx. (linqua dolosa cum carbonibus
juniperi) qui incensi sum in Gelcemza, and other passages to the same
effect. See Sir. li. 4-ss and below on ἀκατάστατον a quotation from
Hermas.

7. πᾶσα γάμ] Introduces the proof of the preceding statement by
reverting to the original figure contained in the word χαλιναγωγεῖν.
The fact that the tongue is the one thing which defles man's power to
control it is a sign that there is something satanic in its bitterness.

φύσις] Here used with a pleonastic force, like natura in Latin;
see Plut. illor. 1112 F, where κενοῖ» φύσις is said to be the same as αὐτὸ
τὸ κενὸν, and my n. on Cic. NJ). 11. 13⁴5 alc-i natura. If we are to
translate it, it is best done by an adverb ‘every kind of animal is
naturally subject to man.' Brute nature under all its forms is under

(hl. xii. 173, στέατος τροχόν, db. xxi. 178, and by th«- voncentrie circlos of land and

'l‘aylor's note above, with the Rabbinical tcrminology.
