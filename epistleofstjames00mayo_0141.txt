To WHOM THE EPISTLE IS ADDREssEJ) cxvii

temptation which beset the Jews to substitute legal righteousrieSS‚

the performance of the works os the law with all its slavish
scrupulosity, sor the righteousness which is by saith in Christ3 but
he also takes occasion to warn them against another and 110 less
dangerous error, that an orthodox profession of saith, unaccom-
panied by the fruits of good living, could suffice for salvation.
While the former error forms the subject of the first four chapters
of the Galatiam, the second is dealt with in the two later Chapters.
It is not abstract saith which avails, but saith working by love:
those who fulfil the works os the flesh shall not inherit the kingdom
of God: whatever a inan soweth that shall he reap (Gal. v. 14—
26). So he insists in 1113 Epistle to the Romans that it is not the
hearer but the doer of the law that is justified (ii. 13); that it is
vain to profess a knowledge of God and claim to be a guide to the
blind, an instructor of the foolish, unless we practise what we
preach (ii. 17—23). He warns his readers against laying the
blame of their own sins on God (ix. 19 f011.>; he urges them to
patience in tribulation‚ to perseverance in prayer, to bless and
curse not, to condescend to things that are lowly‚ to give place to
wrath (xii. 12—-19), not to judge others, since we shall all stand
at the judgment-seat of God, to follow after things which make sor
peace, and things whereby we may edify one another (xiv, 3, 4,
10—13, 19); and to turn away from those which cause divisions
(xvi. 17). The parallels from St. J ames will be found in a previous
chapter (p. 92 foll.).

It has been pointed out above that there is no allusion in this
Epistle to the controversy between the J udaizers and the upholders
of Gospel freedom, nay, that this controversy is so entirely ignored
that the writer is able to use the technical ternis of the contro-
versy with a totally different reference. In like manner other
controversies or topics which are handled elsewhere by his con-
temporaries are left unnoticed by him. There is no direct reser—
ence to the atoning sacrifice of Christ; none to the Sacraments3
none to the details of the Second Coming3 none to Church
organization, as in the Pastoral Epistles. There is no allusion to
incipient gnosticiffin, as in the Epistle to the Colossians and those
to Timothy and Titus and in the writings of St. John. It is
assumed that those addressed accept Jesus as the Messiah‚ that
the new law of liberty has been written in their hearts bytho
