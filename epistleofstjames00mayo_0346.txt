86 ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Thc ten commandments are never called οἱ δέκα νόμοι. But might not
St. J ames uncousciously pass from the collective sense of νόμος to the
particular precepts of which it consisted, without reflecting that,
strictly speaking, such a use of the terni was illegitimate? The other
explanation is not without difficulty. We have plenty of examples of
the substantival use of the neuter ἓν in the nominative and accusative,
but not, Ι think, in the other cases,

γέγονεν πάντων ἕνοχος.] For perfect following aorist see above i. 24.
’Ἔνοχος (lit. ‘in the power of’) is used with a genitive of the offence
(‘guilty of theft'), of the punishment (ἐν. θανάτου Matt. xxvi. 66), of
the law sinned against, as here. It takes a dative of the tribunal.
Πάντων is equivalent to ὅλου τοῦ νόμου.

St. James seems to have had in his mind the case of one who, think-
ing himself to be religious (i. 26), assumes· that all is right with him,
like the Pharisee in the pai-able <Luke xviii. 11). Some of the Rabbis
actually laid it down that obedience to certain laws, eg. the law about
fringes and phylacterieS, was as good as obedience to the whole.¹ Of.
Midrash Mishle on Prov. i. 10 qui unum praeceptum servat est ac si
totam quem servasset. On the other hand, the principle here affirmes]
by St. James is also to be found in the sayings of the Rabbis: thus
Schegg gives a story from a Midrash on Numbers ;2 ‘ R. Hunna having
taught his disciples that he xvho committed adultery broke all the
commandments, was asked by them to explain how this could be true
of the fourth commandinent' 3 and NVetstein to the same effect quotes
two sayings of R. Jochanan from Sabb. f. 70. 2 sisaciat onmia, unum
vero omittat, onmium et sinqulorum ‘reus est ,· and Pesikta f. 50. l onmis
qui dicit, totam leqem esso z'n me ‘recipio praeter verbum unum, hic ser-
monem D'omini sprevit et praecepio. ejus irrita fecit, Horaioth 8 b :
(Levit. v. 5) If. Jose Galilaeus dimit: ‘qui reus est maius, ‘reus est
onmium.ss cf. 4 Maec. 5. 18 μὴ μικρὰν εἶναι νομίσῃς ταύτην, εἰ μιαρο-
φαγήσαιμεν, ἁμαρτίαν· τὸ γὰρ ἐπὶ μικροῖς καὶ μεγάλοις παρανομεῖν ῖσοδύναμόν
ἐστιν, δι’ ἑκατέρου γὰρ ὁμοίως ὑπερηφανεῖται, and Test. xii. Patr. 689 ἄλλος
κλέπτει, ἀδικεῖ, ἁρπάζει, πλεονεκτεῖ, καὶ ἐλεεῖ τοὺς πτωχούς. διπρόσωπον μὲν
τοῖα-ο, τὸ δὲ ὅλον πονηρόν ἐστιν.

This passage of St. James is discussed at length by Augustine in a
letter to Jerome (Ep. 167). He compares the teaching of St. James
with the Stoic doctrine on the ‘ solidarity ' of the virtues and vices, as
to Which see Stob. Eel. ii. p. 108 τὸν μίαν ἔχοντα ἀρετήν πάσας ἔχειν, καὶ
τὸν κατὰ μίαν πράττοντα κατὰ πάσας πράττειν, ib. 116 φασὶ δὲ καὶ πάντα
ποιεῖν τὸν σοφὸν κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀρετάς· πᾶσαν γὰρ πρᾶξιν τελείαν αὐτοῦ
εἶναι, διὸ καὶ μηδεμίας ἀπολελεῖφθαι ἀρετῆς, ib. 120 κατὰ τὸ ἀνάλογον δὲ καὶ
τὸν φαῦλον πάντα ὅσα ποιεῖ κακῶς ποιεῖν καὶ κατὰ πάσας τὰς κακίας, both
doctrines flowing from their conception of virtue as the art of life. In
the same way the Stoics asserted the equality of all virtues, Diog. L.
