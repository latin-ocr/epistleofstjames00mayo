characterizes as earthly, psychical, ‹levilish, reminds us os the words in which
Hermas describes the Gnostic 1011011013 and prophets who were to be found at
Rome in the middle of the second century, and must probably be understood
of these. J ude, too, speaks of the (111031103- 113 ψυχικοί, 1111(1 charges them with
complaining os destin y (v. 16 μεμψίμοιροι), which we may compare with
Jamcs i. 13, where we read of 301110 who coniplain os God as tempting them to
evil. so wc are told of a treatisc 11(1(11·(·330(1101110 Gnostic Florinus by Ire-
11110113, 111 111-001 111111 God was not the author of evil. The reference in iV. ll
to those who ‘judae the law, ⁷ would apply to the attacks of such Gnostics as
Ucrdon and Marcion on th’e O. Γ. Lastly, the de‹ radation 01 Paul' 3

justifv ing saith into an unfruitful assent of the intellect was nowhere so likely

to bc found as among rthe Gnostics. To this ultra- Pauline Gnosticis 3111 James
opposcs no Judaizing theolo‹ gy, but the simple rules of 111-’10110111 Christianity
as understood by the (J atholic ( hurch. His polemic does not touch Paul' s own
doctrine: Paul would never 11ονοσ given the name of saith to this dead intel-
lectual assent3 but it does touch 1110 Gnostics who claimed the authority of
Paul, and 11011103111113101113111111111311 between the two views. This is easily expli-
eable from the fact that J 1111103 himself⁷ like his contemporaries (compare the
Ignatian and the Pastoral Epistles)‚ no longer uses saith in its old sense of ab·
solute trust, forming the only foundation of Christian piety, but makes it co-
ordinate with love, patience, obedience‚ works‚ 810.

The Soteriology of the Epistle approaches so nearly to that of the Gospels,
that it is no wonder some have been tempted to assign it to a very early period.
This however has been shown to be impossible by a comparison with other
Christian writings 3 and it is also inconsistent with the absence of all allusion to
thc apologetic and eschatological topics which so much occupied the attention
of the early Church. We find here no attempt to prove that J esus was the
Messiah, and that he would shortly return to reveal the promised salvation.
The undogmatic character of the 01113110“ 13 10 110 explained, like the dogmatic

31101111011γο01 John, not 011 the supposition that it was written before Chris-
tianity had become dog (01111110, but that dog 11111 was already securely settled.
The Church 01 Rome, however, with its predominantly practical tendency‚
rejected those speculative and inystical elements 01 Paulinism, which were
ret uned and dev eloped by the churches of Asia Minor. And thus it is that the
C1tl1olieized Paulinism of the second century approaches so nearly to pre-
Ε 11113111 111 Ηο1101113111. Monotlieis111‚the Moral Law, Future Retribution3 these
arc the prominent doctrines in b0t1'1; 1110 only difference being that, 111 the
former, these doctrines are based upon Revelation and propagated by an or-
ganized institution.

It will be seen that on several points Pfleiderer recedes from the ’
ground occupied by his predecessors of the negative school. He
allows that our Epistlc could not have been written whilst the
admission of Gentiles into the Church was still a burning ques-
tion : he allows that it is not intended as an answer to the Epistle
to the Romans, and that in fact St. Paul would have assented to
all that is said in it as to the futility of an unfruitful saith. He
does not regard the author as an Ebionite or Essene, or suppose
him to bc addressing some small dissenting body : on the contrary,
J ames is a typical Catholic of 1110 latter half of the second century,
and gives expression to the ethical undogmatic Christianity of the
