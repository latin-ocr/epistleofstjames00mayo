55 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

κατὰ τὸ ἰτ-ολίΙ αι’·τοῦ ἔλεος ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς εἷς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν and ver. 23 3
by St. John (i. 13) οἳ οὔκ ἐξ αἱμάτων ου’δὲ ἐκ θελήματος σαρκὸς οὐδὲ ἐκ
θελήματος ἀνδρὸς ἀλλ’ ἐκ Θεοῦ ἐγεννήθησαν aud iii. 3-8, 1 ep. iv. 10.
As the seed of sin and death is contained in the unrestrained indul-
gence of man's ἐπιθυμία, so the seed of righteousness and life in the
word of God. For the general metaphor compare 1 John iii. 9 πᾶς
ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἁμαρτίαν οὐ ποιεῖ, ὅτι σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ με’νει,
καὶ οὗ δύναται ἁμαρτάνειν ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ γεγέννηται, Psa. lxxxvii. 4-6, lxxx.
18, cxix. 25 (quicken Thou me according to Thy word), Deut. xxxii.
18, Clem. Al. Strom. v. 2, p. 653 P. καὶ παρὰ τοῖς βαρβάροις φιλο-
σόφοις τὸ κατηχῆσαι καὶ φωτίσαι ἀναγεννῆσαι λέγεται, 1 Cor. iv. 15, and
a Jewish saying in Schiirer Ilz'st. of Jewish I'eople, i. p. 317, Eng. tr„
‘ A man’s father only brought him into this world: his teacher, who
taught him wis-dom, brings him into the life of the world to come,’ ¹
also Philo M. 1. p. 147 (αἱ ἀρεταὶ) μὴ δεξάμεναι παρά τινος ἑτέρου ἐπιγονὴν
ἐξ ἑαυτῶν μὲν μόνων οὐδέποτε κυήσουσι· τίς οὖν ὃ σπείρων ἐν αὐταῖς τὸ. καλὰ.
πλὴν ὁ τῶν ὅλων πατήρ, ib. 108 τὸν ἐγκύμονα θείων φώτων λόγον, ib. 123,
where the text Κύριος ἤνοιξε τὴν μήτραν Λείας is explained ὁ Θεὸς τὰς
μήτρας ἀνοίγει σπείρων ἐν αὐταῖς τὰς καλὰς πράξεις, ib. 273. The Choloe
of a word properly used of the mother is explained here by the refer-
ence to v. 15, but it may be compared with Psa. vii. 14 quoted on v.
15 above, and with the use of ὠδίνειν Gal. iv. 19 ; also with Psa. xc. 2
(where the Heb. word translated ‘ thou hadst formed ' means primarily
‘to be in pangs with child,' ‘to bear a child,' Jennings in loc.) and
Psa. xxii. 9, Clem. Hom. ii. 52 Ἀδὰμ ὁ ὑπὸ τῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ χειρῶν κυοφο-
ρηθείς. On the word ἀπεκύησεν see v. 15. On the beneficenee of the
Divine Will cf. Philo M. 1. p. 342 καθ’ ὃ μὲν οὖν ἅρχων ἐστίν, ἄμφω
δύναται καὶ εὖ καὶ κακῶς ποιεῖν...καθ’ ὃ δὲ εὖεργέτης, θάτερον μόνον βού-
λεται, τὸ εὐεργετεῖν, man's greatest blessing is to have the firm hope
which springs from the oonsciousness of the loving will of God (ἐκ
τοῦ προαιρετικῶς εἶναι φιλόδωρον), ib. M. 2. p. 367, 437 βουληθεὶς ὃ Θεὸς
διὰ ἡμερότητα καὶ φιλανθρωπίαν παρ’ ἡμῖν τοῦθ’ ἱδρύσασθαι κ.τ.λ., Clem. Al.
J’aed. i. 6. p. 114 P ὡς γὰρ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ (his absolute will) 2 ἔργον ἐστί,
καὶ τοῦτο κόσμος ὀνομάζεται, οἷ’·τως καὶ τὸ βούλημα αὐτοῦ (his desire) ἀνθρώ-
πων ἐστὶ σωτηρία, καὶ τοῦτο ἐκκλησία καλεῖται, ib. Sl‘rom. Vli- p. 855 P.
οἵτε γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς ἅκων ἀγαθός, ὃν τρόπον τὸ πῦρ θερμαντικόν, ἑκούσιος δὲ ἡ τῶν
ἀγαθῶν μετάδοσις αὐτῷ, Plato Tim. 29 (on the cause of creation) λέγωμεν δι’
ἥντινα αἰτίαν γένεσιν καὶ τὸ πᾶν τόδε ὁ ξυνιστὰς ξυνέστησεν. ἀγαθὸς ἦν»
ἀγαθῷ δὲ οὐδεὶς περὶ οὐδενὸς οὐδέποτε ἐγγίγνεται φθόνος.

ι λόγῳ ἀληθείας.] The word (explained in the parallel passage, 1 Pet.
i. 25, to be τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν εἷς ὑμᾶς, as in Rom. x. 8, 17) is God's
instrument sor communicating the new life: see below v. 21 λόγος
