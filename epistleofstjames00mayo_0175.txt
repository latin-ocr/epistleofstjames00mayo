ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cli

to call to mind the history of the same struggle in regard to the
writings of classical authors. There too a narrow a priori dogma-
tism has in times past attempted to deprive us of half the dia-
logues of Plato and some of the noblest satires of Juvenal 3 but in
the great majority of instances the result of the close examination
to which the Classical writings have been subjected has only served
to establish more firmly the genuineness of the disputed books and
passages, and so we cannot doubt it will be with the New Testa-
ment.1 Experience proves the truth of the maxim-”Opinionum

commenta delet dies, naturae judicia confirmat.

1 It is especially interesting to note how in both spheres we find the first thoughts
of youth corrected by the second thoughts of maturer age. Thus Zeller, who in
his Platonisclw Studien, 1839, had argued against the genuineness of Plato’s De
Leyibus, 111 his Εἴπω-3] of Greek· Philosophy treats it as the undoubted work of Plato.
In like manner Kern, who in an article 111 the Tab. Theoloq. Zeitschr. for 1835,
part 2, had ascribed our epistle to an unknown writer of the 2nd century, argues
in his commentary, 1838, 111 favour of its genuineness; De Wette, who 111 1116
earlier editions of his conunentary had denied the authenticity of the epistle, 111 his
5th edition (1848) regards it as probably authentic ; Lechler, who in the 1st and
2nd editions of his book on the Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Times had made it a
post-Pauline production, treats it as pre-Pauline in his last edition of 1885 (Eng. tr.
1886); and from the preface to the 2nd edition of Ritschl’s Altlcatholische Kiralw,
1857, 11 would seem that Ritschl's views had developed in a similar direction.
