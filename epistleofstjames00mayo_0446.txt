expression of the doctrine of free justification than the words before

Rae. ENERATION.

It is worth while to compare the different terms used in the Bible
to express the change wrought 111 man's nature by the Divine influence.

(l) It 15 described as a new birth. This is expressed in the text by
the verb ἀποκυέω. St«. Peter in his First Epistle (i. 23) employs the
verb ιῖιάγεννάω ‘being born again not of corruptible seed, but of incor-
ruptible, through the living and abiding word of G0d‚' cf. ib. ii. 2.
St. John has either γεννάω ἄνωθεν 01· the simple γεννάω, as in i. 12, 13,
‘ As many 115 received 111111, to them gave he power to become the sons
of (lod, even to them that believe 011 his name : which were born, not
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
‹÷0‹l‚’ ib. iii. 3 ‘except a inan be born from above, he cannot see the
kingdom of God‚' this new birth being further explained by the words
111 verses 5, 6, ‘except a inan be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the
tle-h is flesh3 and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit ' 3 simi—
larly l ep. iii. 9 ‘ every one who is born of God committeth not sin;
for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he 15 born
of God’ 3 ib. v. 4 ‘ whatsoever is born of God (πᾶν τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ
τοῦ Θεοῦ) overcometh the world, and this is the victory that over-
cometh the world, even our faith,' cf. also ii. 29, iv. 7, V. 1, 18. St.
Paul uses the word παλιγγενεσία 111 Tit. iii. 5 ‘according to his mercy
he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Ghost‚’ and addi-esses the Galatians as ‘ my little children of whom l
travail in birth until Christ be formed in you ¹ (Gal. iv. 19).

(2) Nearly related to this is the description of the change as that
of adoption (υἱοθεσία) 01· 5011511111, for which see Rom. viii. 14-17, ‘ As
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For
ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received
a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father . . . The Spirit
itself witnesseth with our spirit, that we are the children of God‚’
cf. Gal. iv. 5, 6, Eph. i. 5.

(3) Or again, that which speaks of a new beart, a new man, a new
creation, a new nature, cf. Ezek. xi. 19 ‘ I will put a new spirit
within you 3 and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will
give them a heart of fleshff ll». xxxvi. 25-27‚ Jer. xxxi. 33, Ps. li. 10,
2 Cor. v. 17 ‘If any inan be in Christ, heis a new creature (καινὴ
κτίσις) , old things have passt away 3 behold all things are become neW‚'
Eph. iv. 22 ‘ that ye put off the old man which is being destroyed in
accordance with the lusts of deceit, and be renewed in the spirit of
your mind, and that ye put on the new man which after God is
created in righteousness and holiness of t1·uth,' 2 Pet. i. 4 ‘in order
that through the promises ye. may become partakers of the divine
nature,’ Gal. vi. 15, Eph. ii. 15, Col. iii. 9, 10.

(4) This new nature is further described as a resurrection from
