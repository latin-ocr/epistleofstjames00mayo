88 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

of speech (on which sce cli. iii. below), as well as of action (on which see
vv. 14---26 of this chapter). The reference in οὕτως is to the following
ὡς, as in l Cor. ix. 26 οὕτω πυκτεύω ὡς οὐκ ἀέρα δέρων, ib. iii. 15 σωθήσεται
οὕτως ὡς διὰ πυρός.

ὡς διὰ νόμου ἐλευθερίας μέλλοντες κρίνεσθαι.] The absence Of the article,
which was used in i. 25, serves to give prominence to the qualifying
genitive. For other instances in N. T. of the Classical use of ὡς
with part. cf, 1 Cor. iv. 18, 2 Cor. v. 20, Heb. xiii. 17, and Winer
p. Ti'Qf.

13. ή γὰρ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ μὴ ποιήσαντι ἕλεος.] The reading ἀνέλεος is
found in all the best MSS. instead of ἀνίλεως. Neither form occurs else-
where, but we find ἀνελεής (in scholiasts) and the more classic-al ἀνηλεής
(Plato), ἀνελεήμων (Wisd. xii. 5, Rom. i. 31). As to the formation,
ἀνέλεος is regular from the classica] ὁ ἕλεος (like ἄλογος, ἄθεος), but
τὸ ἔλεος is the fol-ln used in N.T.,¹ from which would regularly be
formed ἀνελεής (like εὐγενής from γένος) 01· ἀνηλεής (like ἀνηρεφής
from ἐρέφω). We have another reference to κρίσις below v. 12.
With ποιεῖν ἔλεος cf. Josh. ii. 12 ὀμόσατέ μοι ὅτι ποιῶ ὑμῖν ἕλεος καὶ
ποιήσατε καὶ ὑμεῖς ἕλεος, Matt. vi. 2 ὅταν ποιῇς ἐλεημοσύνην, Tobit. Xii. 9
οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐλεημοσύνας καὶ δικαιοσύνας. F or the thought cf. Matt. V. 7,
vi. 14, vii. 1, xviii, 28-35 the parable of the clebtor, XXV. 41-46 the
deror-iption of the judgment, Tit. iii. 5, below v. 20, Psa. xviii. 25, 26,
Prov. xvii. 5, Sirac. xxviii. Qff. ἄφες ἀδίκημα τῷ πλησίον σου καὶ τότε
δεηθέντος σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου λυθήσονται, Tobit. iv. 7—12, Test. Xii. Patr.
p. (541 ἔχετε εὖσπλαγχνίαν κατὰ παντὸς ἀνθρώπου ἐν ἐλέει ἵνα καὶ ὃ Κύριος
εἷς ὑμᾶς σπλαγχνισθεὶς ἐλεήσῃ ὑμᾶς, ὅτι καί γε ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων ἡμερῶν ὁ Θεὸς
ἀποστέλλει τὸ σπλάγχνον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ὅπου εὑρῇ σπλάγχνα ἐλέους,
ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικεῖ, Dein. Mid. 547 οὐδείς ἐστι δίκαιος τυγχάνειν ἐλέου τῶν
μηδένα ἐλεούντων. The reference to lnercy looks backward to i. 27 and
forward to ver. 15 foll.

κατακαυχᾶται ἕλεος »mlo-ems] ‘lilercy triumphs over judgmenb.' The
conipound verb is found also below iii. 14 and Rom. xi. 183 the simple
verb above 1. 9. For the thought see Hosea vi. 6 ἔλεος θέλω ἢ θυσίαν,
quoted in Matt. ix. 13, where the Pharisees complaiu of Jesus eating
with publicans ancl sinners, and again Matt. xii. 7 when they find fault
with the ‹lisciples for eating the ears of cor113 Luke vii. 47, 1 Pet. iv.
8, Matt. xxiii. 23. The absence of a connecting particle is a feature in
the vigorous style of the writer, of. below v. 6 κατεδικάσατε, ἐφονεύσατε
τὸν ὃικαιον· οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν, and above i. 19 ταχὺς εἷς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι,
βραδὺς εἷς τὸ λαλῆσαι. Some MSS. insert δέ, as in ver. 15 below,
which would limit the scope of the words by presenting them as an
antithesis to the preceding clause. It is such of course in the first
instance: as tho fuilure to show mercy or consideration for others
forbids ns to expet-t niel-cy oui-solves, so by the exercise of mel-cy man
gatliers to hinnelf ‘a good reward against the (lay of necessity' (Tobit
iv. 9), since ‘ G od is not uni-ighteous to fol-get the labour that proceedeth
