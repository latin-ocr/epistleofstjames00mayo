no evidence that the controversy did cool down during that period.
On the contrary, the furious assault 01 1116 Jews on St. Paul at
Jerusalem (A.D. 58) turned on this very question. When hc
began to speak of his commission 10 1116 Gentiles, they burst out,
‘ Away with such a fellow from the earth ' (Acts xxii. 22) 3 and St.
J ames had previously warned him that, among the believing Jews,
there were many thousands zealous for the law, who had been
informed that he taught the Jews among the Gentiles to forsakc
Moses and not to circumcise their children (Acts xxi. 20, 21)
This was at Jerusalem : how far the excitement was from having
cooled down in the provinces, is evident from the Epistle to the
Galatians (57). It does 1101 seem that the baptism 01 Cornelius
had aroused anything like the same exaspelation, partly 110 doubt
because St. Peter was not suspected as St. Paul was, partly because
Cornelius was already a ‘ proselyte of the gate,' and did not pass at
once from heathenism 10 Ohristianity like St. Paul's converts On
hearing the explanation of the former ‘ they of the circumcision '
held their peace and glorified God' (Acts xi. 18). There is no
reason therefore for throwing back the date of the Epistle 10 1116
period before the conversion of Cornelius. But it probably was
not much later, for we read shortly afterwards (Acts xi. 20) that the
Greeks in Antioch received the word from some of those who had
been scattered in the persecution of Stephen, and that Barnabas
was sent from Jerusalem to inquire into the circumstances.
