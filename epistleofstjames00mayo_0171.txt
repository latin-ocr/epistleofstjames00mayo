severe reproofs of this unknown J ames? Would there be any
appropriateness in speaking of the rich, as dragging the believers
before the law-courts and blaspheming the noble name by which
they were called 2 Would the thoroughly Hebraic tone of the Epistle
the appeal to the example of Elijah, J ob and the prophets instead
of Christ, the phrase ‘ Lord of Sabaoth‚' the warning against the
use of J ewish oaths, the stern censure of landowners who withheld
the wages of the reapers, suit the circumstances of the Christians
of Rome in that age? Where were the free labourers referred to 2
