may have committed against him, and join in prayer for him, in order
that he may be healed of his bodily ailment,' 1010 1116 general rule ‘con-
fess your trespasses to each other, and pray for each other at all times,
that ye may be healed of all your diseases whether of body or soul.‘
The use of the word οῧν implies the close connexion of the present
with the preceding clause (‘ since prayer has such power, pray for each
other 3 and, that you may be able to do this better, confess your faults
to each other ²).

If we read ἁμαρτίας 11 18 more natural 10 understand the confession
to refer not to trespass towards man, but to sins towards God
(though ἁμαρτάνω 18 also used of the former, as in Matt. xviii. 15, 21).
Such confession (ἐξομολόγησις)1 was made to John the Baptist (Matt. iii.
6) and by the penitents at Ephesus to Paul (Acts xix. 18), but for long
after the apostolic age it seems 10 have been unusual, except 111 the
case of converts or penitents who were under ecclesiastical censure.
For others the words of Augustine held good (Cous. x. 3) quid milii
est cum homiuibus ut audiant coufessiones meas, quasi ipsi sanaturi sint
omues lauquores meos, and the even stron ger words of Chrysostom (II om.
xm. iu Gen. p. 175) quoted in Bingham xviii. 3, and in Dict. of Cla. Aut.
under Exomoloqesis. We need not however suppose any reference here
10 a formal confession of sin, but merely to such mutual confidences
as would give a right direction. to the prayers offered by one for
the other : so Augustine‚ commenting on this verse (Tract. 58 iu Johan.
quoted by Bingham, l.c.), and Bede quotidiana leviaque peccata alter-
utrum coaequalibus confiteamur eoru-mque quotidiana credamus oratione
salvari ,· though the latter adds qravioris leprae immunditiam juxta
leqem sacerdoti pandamus atque ad ejus arbitrium qualiter et quanto
tempore jusserit purificare curemus. The Greek Commentators have no
note here. Origen (Hom. ii. iu Ps. amacii„ Lomm. xii. p. 266) points
out the use of such confession and at the same time recommends
caution in choosing the person to whom confession should be made.
He does not limit the selection to presbyterS, though they would
naturally be thought of, and are generally specified by later writers on
the sub'ect.

SomeJ of the Romish controversialists, as BeHarmine, cited by Hooker
vi. 5, maintain that 81. J ames in this passage alludes to auricular con-
fession, but 0036160 again speaks the language of common sense: ‘nec
liic est sermo (le confessione sacramentali (ut patet ex eo quocl dicit ‘ con-
fitemini iuvioem' ,· sacramentalis euim consessio uou fit invicem, secl sacer-
dotibus tautum), secl (le coufessione qua mutuo fatemur rios peccatores ut
oretur pro uobis, et cle confessione hinc et iude erratorum pro mutua
placatione et reconciliatione. The practice of auricular confession was
not made generally obligatory even by the Church of Rome till the
Lateran 00110011 of 1215 under Innocent HL, which ordered that every
adult person should confess to the priest at least once in 1116 year. In
all other Churches it is still optional. Mutua] confession was an early

ολογοῦμαι, see 1 John i. 9 ἐὰν ὁμολογῶμεν τὰς ἁμαρτίας. In the LXX. ἐξαγορεύω 18
used in the same sense. M cp
