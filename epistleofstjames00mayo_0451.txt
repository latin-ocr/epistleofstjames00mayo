HEARING THE Wonn.

The parallel passage 111 St. Pel er shows that the immediate reference
here is to the good seed of the NVord sown by the preaching of the
Apostles. But the rule laid down by St. James need not be confined
to this. It is a direction as to the way in which all good thoughts, all
higher aspirations, all that raises and purifies our ideal, should be
received in the mind. As St. Paul says (Phil. iv. S), ‘whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things
are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, these things we are to
think upon,' whether we read them 111 books, or see them in the lives
and actions of other men, 01· have them suggested to us by the
teachings of art or nature, or by the voice of conscience, or whatever
else may seem to come through the more immediate inspiration of
God. In respect to all of these the lesson is the same: ‘take heed
how ye hear.' Let your hearts and minds be receptive of these higher
1111111611063. Hearken for the still small voice, ponder its accents,
submit yourselves humbly and lovingly to its guidance. Keep a firm
hand on vanity‚ pride and passion, lest they get the dominion over
you, and drive away the Spirit or drown His voice within you. To the
same effect are the words of the Psalmist, ⁴ Commune with your own
heart upon your bed, and be still,' ⁴ Ι will hearken what God, the
Lord, will say concerning me‚' ‘Rest in the Lord and wait patiently
for Him ’ 3 and the words of the youthful Samuel, ‘ Speak, Lord, for thy
servant hearethss In like manner Wordsworth speaks of the
influences of nature.

But pure contemplation is not enough. Man is made for action, as
well as for thought and feeling ; and if the latter have 110 influence on
his action, they become merely 6 refined sels-indulgence, and tend to
dull the moral sense, and harden the beart, until moral renewal
becomes all but impossible, because we have destroyed the natural
connexion between the 611101-101161 stimulus and the response in act.
In the well-known words of Bp. Butler: ‘Going over the theory of
virtue in one's thoughts, talking well, and drawing fine pictures of it 3
this is so far from necessarily or certainly conducing to form habits of
virtue in him who thus employs himself, that it may even harden
the mind in a contrary course and render it gradually more insensible,
that is, form 6 habit of insensibility to all moral considerat-iens. For,
from our very faculty of habit, passive impressions by being repeated
grow weaker.' Few things are more fatal to moral and spiritual,
growth than the satisfaction derived from a merely aesthetic or
sentimental religion.

But, it may be urged, is not a contemplative life a legitimate
