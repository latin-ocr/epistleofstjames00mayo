ccx THE EPISTLE OF ST. J AMES

may reasonably suppose that our author would not have scrupled to
avail himself of the opportunities within his reaeh, so as to master the
Greek language, and learn something os Greek philosophy. This
would be natural, even if we think of James as impelled only by a
desire to gain wisdom and knowledge for himself, but if we think
of him also as the principa] teacher of the ,Jewish believers, many
of whom were Hellenists‚ instructed in the wisdom of Alexandria,
then the natural bent would take the shape of duty : he would be
a student of Greek in order that he might be a more effective
instructor to his own people.1 The use of rare compoumls, to
which the Bishop calls attention, is certainly remarkable; but I
am not sure that it is most easily explained by his supposition of
the employment of a professional interpreter. A man of ability,
who has to express himself in a foreign tongue, which he has
learnt partly from books, is not unlikely to be insensible to the
distinction between the language of poetry and prose, and to eke
out his limited resources by combining familiar roots. I think
this might be illustrated from the style of the Book of Wisdom,
and from the English writings of foreigners‚ eg. Kossuth's Speeclzes.

It appears to me then (l) that the phenomena of the Greek
epistle, which goes under the name of St. James, are strongly
against its being a translation3 (2) that the writer was acquainted
with the Greek books of the Apocrypha and with the principles of
the Stoic philosophy3 (3) that the balance of probability is in
favour of St. J ames having been able to write Greek, but that this
need not preclude us froin supposing that he may have availed
himself of the assistance of a Hellenist ‘brother’ in revising his
Epistle. A fourth reason which indisposes me to ¹accept the
hypothesis of an Aramaie original is the fact of its disappearance
without leaving any trace behind. The existing Syriae version of
St. James is generally supposed to be a translation from the Greek ;
and ‘it is significant that the Edessene scribes do not seem to
recognize any tradition that the Epistle was written in any language

¹ It mav be worth while to note that James is mentioned hy an ancient writer as
the translator of the original inlu-ew of St. Matthew's Gospel into (otras—ek, sve the
Synopds Scriysttnrau Sacrae includi-d in tho. writings of Athanasius (Migrw, vol. iv.
p. 432) τὺ μὲν οὖν κατὰ Ματθαΐον εὐαγγέλιον ἐγράφη ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τοῦ Ματθαίου τῇ
Ἐβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ...ἡρμηνεύθη δὲ ὑπὸ Ἰακώβου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου τὸ κατὰ σάρκα,
ὃς καὶ πρῶτος ἐχειροτονήθη ἐπίσκοπος ὑπὸ τῶν ἁγίων ἀποστόλων ἐν Ἰεροσολύμοις.
Probably this was only a guess suggested hy the resemblance between our Epistle
and St. Matthew’s Gospel.
