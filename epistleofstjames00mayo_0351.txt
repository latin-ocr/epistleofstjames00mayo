with seeming kindness and what sounds like an order to others to
provide for their immediate relief, but without taking any step to carry
out the order. Compare Hor. 2 Sat. S. 25 tibi di quaecunque preceris
commoda (lent. To have said directly ‘ go and get warm, go and eat,'
would have been giving an order which it was plainly not in their own
power to obey: the other mode of address (like the barren fig-trce)
excites a momentary delusive hope analogous to the impression pro-
duced by faith without deeds. It could only be rightly used where
miraculous power accompanied the word, as in Mark v. 34 ὕπαγε εἷς
εἰρήνην καὶ ἴσθι ὑγιὴς ἀπὸ τῆς μάστιγός σου. Otherwise it is only a
specimen of that hypocrisy of saying without doing (λέγῃ ἔχειν ver. 14)
which called forth the severest reproof of St. James as of his Master.
The active of θερμ. 13 common in Classical writers and is found once in
LXX. (Sirac. 38. 17) θέρμανον κοπετόν, ‘ make hot the wailing,' never 111
N.T. : θερμαίνεσθαι occurs elsewhere in N.T. only 111 Mark xiV. 54, 67,
John xviii. 18, 25 of Peter wal-ming himself at the fire: in LXX. we
find it with passive sense Hos. vii. 7 ἐθερμάνθησαν ὡς κλίβανος aud in
Hagg. i. 6 used, as here, with reference to clothing, ἐφάγετε καὶ οὐκ εἰς
πλησμονήν...περιεβάλεσθε καὶ οὐκ ἐθερμάνθητε (where it must mean, nob
‘did not wal-m yourselves,⁷ but ‘were not warmed '), so Job xxxi. 20
ἀπὸ κουρᾶς ἀμνῶν μου ἐθερμάνθησαν οἱ ὦμοι αὐτῶν, 1 Kings i. 1 (of David)
περιέβαλλον αὐτὸν ἱματίοις καὶ οὐκ ἐθερμαίνετο, tropically Psa. xxxviii. 3
ἐθερμάνθη ἡ καρδία μου (‘1nyheart was heated') καὶ ἐν τῇ μελέτῃ μου
ἐκκαυθήσεται πῦρ. Τ110 passive is also common in classical writers, as
Eur. El. 402 χαρᾷ θερμαινόμεσθα καρδίαν. There is just as little objection ‘co
taking χορτάζεσθαι as passive. The noun χόρτος ‘ fodder,¹ on which see
above i. 11, 13 used of human food by Hipponax the satiristfon 34 Β.
δούλιος χόρτος. The verb, which is only used by classical writers of
beasts or men like beasts (Plato Περ. ix. 586 βοσκημάτων δίκην βόσκονται
χορταζόμενοι), 01· as a piece of slang (Eubulus 350 ΒΕ. βόλβοις ἐμαυτὸν
χορτάσων ἐλήλυθα), gets the general meaning of satisfying hunger in
later Greek. Lobeck (Plzry‘n. p. 64) compares it with ἐρεύγεσθαι as
having lost its original specific meaning: see Matt. xiv. 20 ἔφαγον καὶ
ἐχορτάσθησαν (were filled), Phil. iv. 12 μεμύημαι καὶ χορτάζεσθαι καὶ
πεινᾶν, Psa. xxxvi. 19, lviii. 15, lxxx. 16, cvi. 9, cxxxi. 15 τοὺς πτωχοὺς
χορτάσω ἄρτων, Acts vii. 11 οὐχ εὕρισκον χορτάσματα (sustenance). But
the remembrance of the original sense was not quite lost for scholars :
see Clem. Al. Paed. i. ]55 P ιχορτασθέντες ’ φησίν, τὸ ἄλογον τῆς τροφῆς
πλήρωμα χόρτασμα, οὐ βρῶμα εἰπώνε cf. Sturz Dial. illac. p. 200 foll.

μὴ δῶτε δέ] The plural is often used after an indefinite singular, such
as ἕκαστος, τις, ὅστις, See Krueg. Gr. ἓ 58. 4,. 5. ΤΟ avoid separating
words which are closely connected, δέ sometimes takes the third some-
times the fourth place in the sentence, eg. with the preposition (below
v. 12 πρὸ πάντων δέ), with the article (John Χ. 12 ὁ μισθωτὸς δέ), even
the relative (2 Tim. iii. 8 ὃν τρόπον δέ), and with the negative, as here
and Matt. xviii. 25 μὴ ἔχοντος δέ, Acts xvii. 6 μὴ εὑρόντες δέ, Acts
xxi. 34 μὴ δυνάμενος δὲ γνῶναι, xxi. 14 μὴ πειθομένου δὲ αὐτοῦ, SO οὐκ
ἐγράφη δέ, οὐκ ἔγραψα δέ, οὗ θέλομεν δέ. Examples of the fourth place
are John xvii. 20 οὐ περὶ τούτων δέ, Acts XXVii. 14 μετ’ οὗ πολὺ δέ,
