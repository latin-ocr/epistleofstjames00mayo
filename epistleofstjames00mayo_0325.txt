I 23-25 ’ NOTES ’ 67

δύσνους τῷ κάμνοντι τὴν ψυχήν. The inirror was sometimes made of
silver, but more frequently of a mixture of copper and tin (D. ofB. 512).
The point of comparison here is that the Word will show us what needs
to be cleansed and amended in our lives, as the iniri-or in regard to our
bodies. It shows us what we actually are in conti-ast with what our
deceitful heart paints us (ver. 26) ; it shows us also what is the true
ideal of humanity which we are called upon to realize in our lives.

24. κατενόησε καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν] ‘Just :t glanee and he iS Off.⁷ For the
gnomic aorist often used 111 comparisons 500 ver. 11 ἀνέτειλεν,
A. Buttmann, p. 174, Goodwin, M. (md. T. ς’ 30. The proleptic perf.
(on which see Buttmann, p. 172) expresses the sud‹;le11ness and coni<

pleteness of the action, as in Xen. Cyon iv. 2. 26 ὁ γὰρ κρατῶν ἅμα πάντα

συνήρπακεν, Rom. xiv. 23 ὁ διακρινόμενος ἐὰν φαγῇ κατακέκριται, il). vii. 2.
On the combination of aorist and perfect see below ii. 10 ὅστις πταίσῃ
γέγονεν, XVineig p. 3:39. Both he and Buttmann (p. 171) ignore the
special force of the perfect here, and compare it with such barbarous
uses as Apoc. V. 7 ἦλθε καὶ εἴληφε τὸ βιβλίον, where, as often in the
arguments to the speeches of Demosthenes, the perfectrcanuot be
distinguished from the aorist, cf. εἴληχε and πεποίηκεν for ἔλαχε and
ἐποίησεν 111 Pro Pleorm. hyp. p. 944.

εὐθέως ἑπελάθετο.] Dr. Taylor (J. of Phil. vol. xviii. p. 317) has pointed
out that the phrase is borrowed by Hermas in the remarkable passage
Vis. iii. 13. 2.

ὁποῖος ἦν.] The direct form ποῖος 15 always used in Nfs. for indirect
interrogation except in this verse and in Gal. ii. 6, 1 Thess i. 9,
1 Cor. iii. 13. So always τίς, πόσος, πότε, πόθεν for ὅστις, ὁπόσος, ὁπότε,
ὁπόθεν. “On-ov and ὅπως are frequent, but the former is never, the latter
only rarely, used in an interrogative sense.

25. παρακύψας] ‘ bending over in order to examine minutely‚’ ‘ peel-ing
into ' : SO 1 Pet. 1. 12 εἷς ἃ ἐπιθυμοῦσιν ἄγγελοι παρακύψαι. Jt is used Of
John and of Mai-y looking into the sepulchre (John xx. 5, 11), also 111
Sir. xiv. 23 (blessed 15) ὁ παρακύπτων διὰ τῶν θυρίδων σοφίας, Philo M.
2. p. 554 ποῦ γὰρ τοῖς ἰδιώταις θέμις εἷς ἡγεμονικῆς ψυχῆς παρακύψαι
βουλεύματα, in Aet. Thom. Tiscll. p. 230 εἷς χάσμα παρακύψαι, Epict.
De'ss. i. 1, 16 παρακύπτωμεν συνεχῶς τίς ἄνεμος πνεῖ. In Classical writers
we find it sometimes used with the opposite sense of a careless glauce,
eg. Dem. 1 Phil. p. 4ss τὰ ξενικὰ παρακύψαντα ἐπὶ τὸν τῆς πόλεως
πόλεμον πρὸς Ἀρτάβαζον οἴχεται πλέοντα. Clelnent of Rome uses ἐγκύπτω
in the sense of St. Jaines’ παρακ. us in i. 40 ἐγκεκυφότες εἷς τὰ βάθη τῆς
θείας γνώσεως, where Lightfoot refers to other passages, esp. 45 ἐγκύπτετε
εἰς τὰς γραφάς. So also M. Anton. iv. 3 εἷς ἃ ἐγκύψας, ‘conteniplating
which things] '

νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἑλενθερίας.] The careful 1100101- feels that the λόγος
ἀληθείας 15, and must be, the law of his life, though a law of freedom :
it is the ideal on which his eye is to he fixed, not a yoke too
heavy for his shoulslers to bear. Even of the Mosaic law the
psalmist says (xix. 7) ‘the law of the Lord is perfect,’ but this
is merely rudimentary when compared with the law of Christ (Gal.
vi. 2), as is shown in detail in the Sei-mon on the Mount, and
