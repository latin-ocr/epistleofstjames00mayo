cviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

We will next consider the doctrinal basis of St. J ames' practical
teaching. Man was created in the image of God (iii. 9), the All-
Good (i. 13, 17); but he has fallen into sin by yielding to his lower
impulses against his sense of right (i. 14, 15, iv. 1-3‚ 17); and the
natural consequence of sin is death, bodily and spiritual (i. 15, ν. 3, 5).
Not only is man liable to sin3 but as a matter of fact we all sin, and
that frequently (iii. 2). God of His free bounty has provided a
means by which we might conquer sin and rise to a new life, in
His word sowi] in our hearts (i. 18 βουληθεὶς ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς
λόγῳ ἀληθείας, i. 21 δέξασθε τὸν ἔμφυτον λόὙον τὸν δυνάμενον
σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν). Our salvation depends on the way in
which we receive the word (i. 21). [f we have a stedfast saith in
God's goodness as revealed to us through our Lord J esus Christ
(i. 13, ii. 1, i. 5—7); if we read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest
the word, so as to make it the guiding principle of our life, the
law of liberty by which all our words and actions are regulated
(i. 25, ii. 12), then our souls are saved from death, we are made
inheritors of the kingdom promised to those that love God (i. 12,
2511. 5).

But the training by which we are prepared for this crown of life
is not pleasant to the natural man. It involves trial and endurance
(i. 2-4, 12) ; it involves constant watchfulness and sels-control, and
prayer for heavenly wisdom, in order that we may resist the
temptations of the world, the flesh and the devil (i. 26, iii. 2-8, 15,
ἰν. 1, iv. 5). Thus saith is exer-cised3 we are enabled to see things
as God sees them (ii. 1, 5); to rise above the temporal to the
eternal ti. 9—11) 3 to be not simply patient, but to rejoice in afflic-
tion (i. 2, v, 7, 8, 10, 11), and exult in the hope set before us
(i. 9-12) ; until at last we grow up to the full stature of a Christian
(i. 4, iii. 2), wise with that wisdom which comes from above, the
wisdom which is stedfast, unpretending, gentle, considerate, affec-
tionatc, full of mercy and good fmits, the parent of righteousness
and peace (iii. 17, 18).

But there are many who choose the friendship of the world
instead of the fricndship of God, so vexing His Holy Spirit, and
yielding themselves to the power of the devil; yet even then He
does not leave them to themselves, but gives more grace. He
hedgos in their way in the present, and warns them of further
judgment to come (iv. 4—6, v. 1-8). If they humble themselves
