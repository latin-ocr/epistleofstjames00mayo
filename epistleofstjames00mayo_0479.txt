V 12-20 HEALING OF THE SICK 219

the teaching 01 St. James and of the writers of the N.T. in general
goes much further than this. Men are to cast every care upon (md,
knowing that He careth for us. If there is a drought, 111011 pray for
rain 3 if there is a bodily irifirinity, they pray for its removal 3 if there
is danger or difficulty inipending‚ the example of Christ Himself shows
that we are not wrong in asking that ‘ this cup may be taken away‚'
provided we add ‘ nevertheless, not my will, but Thine be done.' In
these latter cases, however, we are told that prayer is absurd‚ or even
impiouS, because it brings us into collision with the laws of nature:
and certainly, when we are convinced that a certain sequence regularly
follows a certain antecedent by natural law, or, as Christians would
say, by God's ordinance,—in such a case it would be not only folly,
but the extreme of presumption to ask that God's ordinance might 110
¹set aside 101· our convenience. The husbandman does not pray that
the grain which he has sown one day may spring up into the golden
crop of corn 011 the next day, or that it may come to maturity unaided
by rain or sunshine. These things he knows to be impossibilities, and
he does not ask for them, because he cannot deliberately desire them.
But where a change for the better is not, so far as he knows, an im-
possibility, there he cannot help strongly wishing for the change; and
in the mind of a Christian every wish becomes a prayer, because it is
joined with the aspiration ⁴ Thy will be done.⁷ If meteorological
science is ever so far advanced that the meteorologist can predict the
weather with the same certainty as the astronomer predicts an eclipse,
prayer for fine weather would become impossible 3 but wherever desire
is possible, there prayer is possible and right. We do not even pray for
the recovery of the sick, when the symptoms make it clear that God’s
will is otherwise : our prayer is then for a peaceful and painless departure.
As the request for the prayers of the Church, so the service for the
Visitation of the Sick is founded upon this passage. The parish priest‚
being notified of the sickness, attends by the bedside, joins in prayer
for the sick person, reminds him of his duty to make confession both
01 1118 8111 to God and of his shortcomings towards other men, assures
him of the Divine forgiveness promised to all repenting sinners,
administers to him the Sacrament 01 the Body and Blood of Christ the
ever-present Saviour‚ in whom he realizes his communion with all saints,
not only those still on earth, but those who have crossed the dark
river before him, and whom he hopes soon to rejoin on the other side.
The Church of Rome claims to keep closer to 813. J ames’ injunction
by its use of Extreme Unction for the remission of sins and the spiritual
comfort of the dying. It is one 01 13110 curious phenomena of our time
that English Churchmen have been found to regret that our Bishops
persist in withholding from the clergy the power to administer this
sacrament of comfort13 as to which it has been shown in the Notes

ancc with the whole stream of Christian belief until recent 1111108, that the spiritual
blessing ‹leclared to attend the unction of the sick is still given by God : . . . but
as modern English bishops do not bless 011 101· the purpose, this means of grace is at
present withheld from their flocksJ
