the instinctive shrinking from any approach to 111180110οἀ, as well as
from auything which could give pain or do mischief. There is nothing
unnatural or artificial in such control as this, nothing to excite a
suspicion 01 ,J osuitism.

But if wc have no difficulty in finding cases in which we should all
echo the admonition of St. James3 11 we should allow that for the
Jews of his time, as for certain races in our own time, the rule ⁴ slow
to speak' might be 01 very general application3 do we not also find
cases, especially in England, where a stimulus is needed in the opposite
direction‘l Is there not sometimes a stolid absence 01 interest both in
persons and things, which does away with the chief motive for conver-
sation? or a sluggishness of thought and speech, which amounts almost
to dumbness‘l or a timidity and self-distrust, which make it a painful
effort to open oneself to others? In such cases surely the injunction
should be : Try to break through the isolation in which you have placed
yourself : learn 1ο interest yourself more in others: remember that
you too in your own small circle are intended not only to do the will
of God, but to be an oracle of God, reflecting back that aspect of the
Divine Glory, to manifest which is the reason 01 your creation.
Certainly neither Moses nor J eremiah were commended for their slow-
ness of speech. In vain the former pleaded ‘ l am not eloquent, but

the sight of the indignation produced in persons 01 a more genereus
nature by a mean or unkind action. We have many examples of such
indignation in the Bible, notably in the language of John the Baptist
and 01 our Lord. What the text means is ‘ do not give way to the
first impulse to anger. Think how 011011 you have had to repent of
what you have done or said under the influence of passion ; how 011011
you have found that you had misapprehended the facts, or misinter·
preted the motives of the supposed offender. Even when there can be
no reasonable doubt on these points, in any case do not let yourself be
carried away by blind passion 3 ask yourself how much 01 your anger
