Tho term κόσμος 13 lim-rowed from 1116 Greek philosopha-rs who used it
to express, first, the divine ordor apparent in the universe, and then the
actual universe and especially the heavenly bodies. In 1116 pantheistic
system of the Stoics the κόσμος itsclf was deified. By the writers of
the N. T. it is generally used in a dyslogistic sense. Thus St. ‹Jaines
(1. 27) bids his readers ‘keep themselves unspotted from the world.y
In ii. 5 he speaks of those who were ‘ poor in the xiew of 1116 world ’
as being ‘rich in saith? ln iii. 6 116 speaks of the tongue as 1116
organ of the unrighteous world in our body. Here he says ‘thc
friendship of the world is enmity with God.' st. John (1 Ep. ii.
15-17) analyses the 111111161166 of the world into the ‘lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.⁷ He tells us further (iii. l)
that the world knew not God and therefore knows not the sons of
God 3 (iii. 13) that the world hateth you, (iv. 5) that false prophets
are of the world and the world hears them, (v. 4) ‘whatever 13
begotten of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory which
overcometh 1116 world, even our faith ’,- (v. 19) ‘ the whole world lieth
in wickedness’ (or ‘in the evil one'); (iii. 17) ‘ the world’s good ⁷ is

used in the same sense as ‘ the unrighteous Manim0n.' So in his ¹
Gospel we read (xiv, 17) that ‘the world cannot receive the Comforter'3 Ἰ
(xiv. 30) ⁴ the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me ’ 3 ¹

(xv. 19) ‘ If ye were of the world the world would love its own, but Ι
chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.’ So
St. Paul ‘ the world through its wisdom knew not God ' (l 0012‘1. 21) 3
‘ God chose the base things of the world ' (1 Gor. i. 27) 3 and St. Peter
‘ that ye may become ραι-11111613 of the divine nature, having escaped
the corruption which is in the world through lust ' (2 Pet. i. 4). lt 13
evident that in these passages the world is used not for the externa]
universe, but for the world of men, that same world of which we are
told that God so loved it, that he sent his Son that the world through
him might be saved (Joh. iii. 16, 17) 3 and yet St. James says that one
who loves the world thereby becomes an enemy of God. How are we
to explain 111132 What 13 1116 exact nature of that world which is so
dear to God, and so dangerous to man ’1

In the simplest 361136 of the word, the world is each man’s natural
environment‚ that into which he enters at birth, and from which he
departs in death. It is the immediate present, the seen and temporal,
of which our senses bear witness, in eontrast to the unseen and eterna] 3
as St. John says ‘ the world passeth away and the lusts thereos, but he
that doeth the will of (1οά abideth for ever.’ It supplies the objects of
all our appetites, the stimulus to our activities, the occasions of our
