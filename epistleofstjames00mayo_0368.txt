108 THE EPISTLF. OF ST. ..TAMEs

2 Pet. ii. 13 σπῖλοι καὶ μῶμοι, Test. Aser. p. 690 Fabr. ὃ πλεονεκτῶν τὴν
ψυχὴν σπιλοῖ. For the thought cf. Matt. xv. ll τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τοῦ
στόματος τοῦτο κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον. The phrase ὄλ. τ. σῶμα occurs above
vers. 2 and 3.

φλογίζουσα] Here only in N.T. Psa. xcvi. 3 πῦρ φλογιεῖ τοὺς
ἐχθρούς, Wisd. iii. 28 πῦρ φλογιζόμενον ἀποσβέσει ὕδωρ, EXOd. ix. 24.

τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως] In this extremely difficult expression it
seems better to read τροχόν ‘wheel’ than τρόχον ‘ course' (for which
δρόμος is the word used in the N.T. and LXX.), as the former alone
supplies a natural figure in the wheel which, catching fire from the
glowing axle‚ is compared to the wide-spreading mischief done by the
tongue. Heisen cites Achmet Oneirocritica 160 (Sth cent. A.D.) εἰ δὲ
ἴδῃ ὅτι ἤλαυνεν ἐν τῷ ὃιφρῷ καὶ οἶ τροχοὶ ἐφλογίσθησαν ἐκ τῆς ἐλάσεως,
εὑρήσει νόσον ἀναλόγως τῆς φλογώο-εως.1 Α consideration of the context
will exclude some of the explanations which have been offered. The
clause is evidently meant to be distinct from and stronger than that
which precedes: it cannot therefore be anything confined to the in—
dividual. This forbids any reference to Eccles. xii. 6 συντροχάσῃ ὁ
τροχὸς ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον, or to physiologica] phrases, such as we find in
Galen llipp. et Plan. 711 borrowed from Plat. Tim. 79 (the whole
process of respiration) οἷον τροχοῦ περιαγομένου γίγνεται, which is after-
wards referred to as ἡ τοῦ τροχοῦ περιαγωγή. On the other hand it cannot,
be referred to the material world, of which Simplicius speaks (Comm. in
Epioe. ΕησῘι. p. 94 b) as τῷ ἀπεραντῷ τῆς γενέσεως κύκλῳ, διὰ τοῦτο ἐπ’

¹ Ι t may be worth while to compare other instanees os the mctaphorical use of
τροχός. In Sibyl. ii. 87 (Phocyl. 27) we find κοινὰ πάθη πάντων· βίοτος τροχός·
ἅστατος ὄλβος, Anacr. iv. 7 τροχὸς ἅρματος ’γὰρ οἶα, βίοτος τρέχει κυλισθείς. In both
os these the point of the comparison seems that of fortune’s whecl; that which is
highest soon changes to lowest, and vica coma,- so iu Sil: ital. vi. 120 per varios
praeceps casus rota volvitur aevi and Boeth. Cous. 2. 2 leaeo vost να vis est, Ιι zcnc continuam
ludum. lu‹lz·mus,· robam volubili orbo versamus, infima menimis, summa infimis mama-c
(laudemus, cf. Plut. Numa p. 69 fin, Clem. Al. »ὃτι-01η. v. p. 672 P. on the emble-
niatic whecl of the Egyptians. In Psa. lxxxiii. 13 ὁ Θεός μου θοῦ αὐτοὺς ὡς τροχόν,
lsa. xvii. 13, ιιἸ). xxix. 5, it is used as an emblem of destruction ‘lnakc them as a
wheel, a whirling thing ⁷: cf. Psa. lxxvii. 18 φωνὴ τῆς βροντῆς σου ἐν τῷ τροχῷ· ‘in the
heavcn' AN. but Hitzig aud others ‘ with a whirlwind.’ In Sirao. xxxvi. 5 τροχὸς
ἁμάξης σπλάγχνα μωροῦ καὶ ὡς ἅξών στρεφόμενος ὁ διαλογισμὸς αὐτοῦ Fritzscho under-
stands the phrase of a constant going round and round in the same rut, making no
advance. Hilgenfeld (Zoilo-clins. τοίς-πῃπῇ. ΤΙιιόΖ. 1873 p.1 soll.) quotes from Lob. Aql.
p.796 passages from Orphic writers in which metempsychosis is stylcd κύκλος 01· τροχὸς
γενέσεως, as Simplic. cle Caelo ii. p. 91 (Ι have been unable to find this in the Berlin
ed. of the Scholia), speaking of Ixion as a symbol of the soul, προσδέδεται ὑπὸ τοῦ
Θεοῦ τῇ τῆς μοίρας τροχῷ καὶ τῆς γενέσεως, ὃν ἀδύνατον μεταλλάξαι κατ’ Ὀρφέα κ.τ.λ.,
Procius in Tim. v. 330 μία σωτη [a ψυχῆς τοῦ κύκλου τῆς ’γενέσεως ἆπαλλάττουσα καὶ
τῆς πολλῆς πλάνης καὶ τῆς ἀνηνυτου ζωῆς ἡ πρὸς τὸ νοερὸν εἶδος ἆναδρομή, where also
there is a reference to the Orphic poems. [The word τροχός in Psa. lxxvii. is th'e
rendering of ⁴ galgal ’‚ the rabbinic word for the eelestial spherc, the plural of which
is used for the several sphcres concentric with the earth, in which the planets were
supposed to be set. 'rhus τροχ. τ. γεν. might stand for ‘the whole sphcre of man's
natm-cst Then φλογίζω might be used with allusion to lightning as an all-pervading
firv, sec Psa. xxix. 7, xcvii. 4, Matt. xxiv. 27. We find τροχοί and πῦρ brought
together in Dan. vii. 9, cf. Sib. Orac. Il. 296 ἐκ ποταμοῦ μεγάλου πύρινος τροχὸς
αὐτούς (ἂμφικαθέξει) ‘an encircling fi1·e.'—-C.'1*.]
