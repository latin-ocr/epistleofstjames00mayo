ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxlv

that it was not recognized as canonical (abor ceusclracklieh als
unyezwez‘felte Schrift)‚ I will here briefly sum up the evidence of
Origen on this point : (1) he never denies the genuineness of the
Epistle; (2) he simply uses in one passage (Gomon. in Joh. xix. 6,
Lomm. ii. 190) the ambiguous phrase ἡ φερομένη Ἰακώβου ἐπιστολή,
which at the outside means that, though the Epistle was in general
circulation under that name, yet he did not take upon himself to
assert its authenticity 3 (3) in Rufinus' Latin translation of Origen⁷s
writings we find our Epistle referred to as follows: Oomm. in ep. ad
Rom. iv. l, in alio scriptume loco, ib. iv. 8 audi et Jaeohum fratrem
Domini, ib. ix. 24 ‘Iacobus Apostolus diosztt, and frequently 3 cf. Hom.
in Eae. iii. 3, viii. 4, Leo. ii. 4, where it is also called Scriptura
divina ‚· (4) these expressions of the Latin, which some have without
ground suspected, are borne out by similar expressions in the
original Greek3 thus in Sel. in Psalm. xxxi. 5 (Lomm. xii. p. 129)
the Epistle (ὡς παρὰ Ἰακώβῳ) is referred to as ἡ «γραφή, and it is
quoted as authoritative in Sel. in Eoeod. xv. 25, Gomon. in Joh. xx.
10 and elsewhere (see above, pp. lxiii. foll.); (ὃ) in two distinct
passages Origen gives a list of the Sacrecl Books‚ and in both of
these the Epistle of St. James is included (Hom. in Gen. xxvi. 18,
Hom. in Jos. vii. 13 see VVestcott, Canon pp. 406 foll)

I next take the assertion that, if oui Epis stle had been wlitten trltwn ,¹31 ἶξοῃω
before the Council of Jerusalem, it must have contained arguments poeni
to prove that J esus was the Messiah, such as those we find Εορὲῃ sue Μ]

ascribed to St Peter in the Acts, and must also have dwelt more withna mm}

‚ upon the Second Coming. If the writer were addiessing uncon- date‘
verted Jews, as St. Peter does in Acts ii.⁷ or were endeavouring to
recall Jews who were in danger of falling away, as the author of,
the Epistle to the Hebrews does, such arguments would no doubt
be in place 3 but as he is writing to believers‚ who accept Christ as
the Lord of Glory and future Judge (James ii. 1, V. 9), such argu-
ments would be out of place in a short letter, directed to the
special object of inculcating a practical morality on those who
were already believers‚ Nor can Ι see why we should expect
more to be said about the Second Coming. Is it not enough
that we are told ‘the J udge stands before the the door‚' and ‘he
that endureth temptation shall receive the crown of life '2
Another point is that James has lost the old meaning of faith, and

makes it, not the foundation of the Christian life, but merely one
