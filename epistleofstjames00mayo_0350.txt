90 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

δέ τις...μὴ δῶτε δέ compare ver. 2 above ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃ...εἷσέλθῃ δέ...
ἐπιβλέψητε δέ.

γυμνοί.] Ηο still has before him the case of the poor who were
slighted in the congregation. The word does not necessarily imply
absolute nakeduess: a person wearing the celonetlz, under-tunic
(χιτωνίσκος or ὑποδύτης), alone was described as naked: thus it is used
ot' Saul after having taken off his upper gai-ments <1 Sam. xix. 24),
of a warrior who has cast off his military cloak (Amos ii. 16), of Peter
without his fisher’s cont (ἐπενδύτης), cf. too Hesiod Op. 391 γυμνὸν
σπείρειν imitated in Georgy. i. 299. The same expressionlis applied to
the poorly clad iu Job xxii. 6, Isa. lviii. 7, Matn. XXV. 36, see l). ofB.
s.V. ‘Dress' p. 454.

λειπόμενοι.] Sec on i. 4. As the best MSS. omit ὦσιν, this must be
tzitl eu With ὑπάρχωσιν, cf. Acts viii. 16 βεβαπτισμενοι ὑπῆρχον. The
llur al is of course not strictly10 urramm atical after the disjunctive con-
juncfflon, but it is a veiy 111111111111 iriegularity· cf Plato Ley. 8. 838
ὅταν ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἀδελφή τῳ γένωνται καλοί, Krueg. Gr. ᾗ 63, 3, 2. So a.
singular subject followed by μετά with gen. is sometimes joined with a
plural verb: see below on δῶτε.

ἐφημέρον.] Only here in N.T. 3 not in LXX. Diod. iii. 31 and Dion.
H. viii. 41 use ‘the phrase ἐφήμερος τροφή, Philo M. 2, p. 538 has τὸ
ἐφήμερον, probably quoted froma comio poet (πένητές ἐσμεν καὶ μόλις
τούφήμερον εἷς αὐτὰ τάναγκαῖα πορίζειν δυνάμεθα). Field cites Ael. V.ll.
iii. 29 Diogenes said he was πτωχὸς δυσείμων, βίον ἔχων τὸν ἐφήμερον,
Menander p. 134 M. στρατεία δ οὗ φέρει περιοισίαν ἐφήμερον δὲ καὶ
προπετῆ βιον. It is defined by 13011111( as τὸ εἷς την ἐπιοῦσαν μὴ μένοι,
ὀλβιώτερός ἐστι.

16. τις ἐξ ὑμῶν] le. 1. 12 εἶπέ τις ἐξ αὐτῶν, and frequently. Sometimes
τις is omitted both in the accusative as Matt. xxiii. 34 ἀποστέλλω
προφήτας...καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀποκτενεῖτε, and in the nominative as John xvi.
17 εἶπον ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ.

ὑπάγετε ἐν εἰρήνῃ.] Cf. the words of the jailor at Philippi to Paul
πορεύεσθε ἐν εἰρήνῃ Acts xvi. 36, Jud. xviii. 6 3 but more commonly we
find εἰς used, implying a future result, as in Mau-k v. 34 with ὕπαγε,
Luke vii. 50 with πορεύου, also oh. viii. 48, 1 Sam. i. 17, xx. 42, with
βάδιζε 2 Sam. XV. 9, ἀπελύθησαν μετ’ εἰρήνης Acts xv. 33. ln Tobib xii.
5 we have ὕπαγε ὑγιαιι ων 111 much the Same sense. It is a formula of
comfort (‘ be at eas& 41111νο no anxiet-y ¹) usu 1lly orounded upon some
act or assui-ance‚ as 1 Sam xx. 42 the oath of friendship between David
and Jonathan, Acts xvi. 343 the order of the magistrates. Here it
should have been followed or preceded by the gift of food and clothing
« instead of the mocking words.

θερμαίνεσθε καὶ χορτάζεσθε] Beysclilag and others take these verbs in
the middle sense 4 warni yourselves and foed yourselves.’ The Revisers
ret-ain the old version ‘ be yc warmocl and fod,’ which certainly gives a
better sense and one more suited to the caustic irony of which St.
‚lanies is a master. The sight of dista-ess is unpleasanb to these slainty
Clu-istians. They bustle out the wretched-looking brother or sister
