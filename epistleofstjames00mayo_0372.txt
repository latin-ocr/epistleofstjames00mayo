112 ² THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Parens noster, quanto valentiora animalia sub iuyum «miserimus, quanto
velociora consequamur, quam nihil sic mortale non sub ictu nostro
positum. Erasmus in his Paraphrase illustratos as. follows: ciem-antur
leones, rmmsuescwzc Hyrides, serviunt eciam elephanti, subiyunlu‘r eb
crocodili, mitescunt aspides, redduntur familiares aquilae et vultures, ad
amiciciam alliciuntur delphini. The writer here follows Gen. i. 28, ix.
2, Ps. viii. 6-8.

8. οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται ἀνθρώπων] But if so, how can the Psalmist
say παῦσον τὴν γλῶσσάν σου ἀπὸ κακοῦ (xxxiv. 13), and vow not to sin with
the tongue (xvii. 3, xxxix. 1)? So Piiov. xiii. 3. This may be partly
explained by the emphatic position of ἀνθρώπων. Man cannot ‹lo it by
himself, but he who is τέλειος may do it (ver. 2), and such pel-fection is
attainable through the help of God given in answer to prayer, see
above i. 5 and compare the Psalmist’s prayer, cxli. 3. So Aug. de nat.
ec (frat. c. 15 non enim ait, linquam nullus domare potest, sed nullus
hominum ‚· πί cum domatur, Dei misericordia, Dei adjutorio, Dei [so-acia
fierifaceanmr. The PelagianS, followed here by Oecumenius, read this
verse as a question (Schegg). In the next place ἡ γλῶσσα, when
regarded as Setting on fire the whole round of life, is not simply the
speech of the individual‚ but that multiplied and re-echoed a thousand-
fold by the voices of others and by the power of the press 3 parva metu
primo moa· sese attollit in auras. However a man may learn to control
his own tongue, these echoes are beyond all human power.

ἀκατάστατον κακόν.] Cf. above i. 8, also Herm. filand. ii. 2} πονηρὰ ἡ κατα-
λαλιά, ἀκατάστατον δαιμόνιόν ἐστιν, μηδέποτε εἷρηνεῦον, where Harn. cites
Orig. in ιῙοιωωι. (Opp. iv. p. 355) οὐκ ὤκνησαν καὶ τὰ νομισθέντα ἂν ἐλάχιστα
εἶναι τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων δαιμονίοις προσάψαι οἳ φήσαντες τὴν ὀξυχολίαν δαι-
μόνιον εἶναι, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὴν καταλαλιάν, and below ver. 16 ἀκαταστασία.
Erdmann and Hofmann read ἀκατάσχετον with eod. Ephr., the Pes-hitto,
and some other versions, and we find the word similarly used by Philo
M. 1. p. 695 τὸ στόμα ὃιανοίξαντες καὶ ἐάσαντες ἀχαλίνωτον, καθάπερ ῥεῦμα
ἀκατάσχετον, φέρεσθαι τὸν ἀκριτόμυθον λόγον ε’ὣσι. This would suit the
passage very well, agreeing with Ps. xii. 43 bnt the other reading is
generally accepted and gives a good sense ‘ restless‚’ ‘ unquiet,' like the
least tamable beasts ; others translate as in i. 8 ‘unstable,' ‘incon-
sistent,' which they think agrees better with v. 9f011., but it is a
somewhat incongruous epithet for κακόν. See above i. 8. We should
naturally take the words ἀκ. κ. as acc. in apposition to τὴν γλῶσσαν,
like i. 8 ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, but the following nom. makes it more prob-able
that there 1s a sudden ch inge of consti uction,’ ακ. κ. being the predicate
of an independent sentence ὃ1111ὺ11 ἡ γλῶσσα understood as subject; ef.
Mark xii. 38 foll. βλεπετε ἀπὸ τῶν θελόντων ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν...οῖ
κατεσθιοντες τας οἷκιας τῶν χηρῶν· ουτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κριμα.
ln the Apocalypse we meet with many of these iriegul· η’ appositions‚

.i. 5 ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῖ,“ υ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός, ib. xx. 2 ἐκράτησεν τὸν
ὸρὲἷικοντα, ὁ ὄφις ο ἀρχαῖος, ὅς ἐστιν διάβολος, Winer‚ p. 668 foll„
1. Buttmann, p. 68 foll. So even in Homer, Il. vi. 395, x. 437.

μεστὴ ἰοῦ θανατηφόρου] For μεστή see below V. 17, 2 Pet. ii. 14,

Rom. i. 29 μεστοὺς φθόνου. The metaphor here is taken from Ps. lviii.
