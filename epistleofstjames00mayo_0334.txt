76 THE EPls'rLE OF ST. JAMES

coinlnentary takes τῆς δόξης, as Ι have done, in apposition to
τοῦ Κυρίου. 111 1111 appendix 011 this verse, to show that the name
Shekinah was 115011 by the ‚Jews of God or of the Messiah, 110
cites Psa. lxxxv. ‘J ἐγγὺς τῶν φοβουμένων αὐτὸν τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ, τοῦ
κατασκηνιῖκται δόξαν έν τῇ γῇ ἡμῶν, 011 which Jeunings notes ‘the
glory 15 certainly ns 111 Ρ5ιι. lxiii. 2, Zech. vi. 12, 13, that of the
Divine Prosunt-0 which now again dawns 011 the restored people...St.
‚John’s description of the Advcnt- of Christ offers an approximate
pztmllel...··the XVord was made 110511 and (lwelt (ἐσκήνωσε) among·
115 and 1νο behold 1115 glory...full of grace and trut11”: 50 here ver. lU
tells of :1 concurrcnco of Divino goodness and truth.' Bassctt refers
also to llagg. ii. 7, U. Zech. ii. 5 ‘ 1, saith the Lord, will be [the] glory
111 the inidst of her,' il). ν. ὃ, 10, and to the book solim-‚1 where the
Son of God 15 spoken of ars the Shckinah. Thus δόξα would appear to
bc equivalent ts«, Ennnanuol, cf. Apoc. xxi. 3 ἡ σκηνή (= Slxekinah) τοῦ
(θεοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, Lev. xxvi. ll, 12 θήσω τὴν σκηνήν μου ἐν ὑμῖν
καὶ...ἐμπεριπατήσω ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ἔσομαι ὑμῶν Θεὸς καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι λαός,
and Pirke Aboth iii. :5 ‘two that sit together and are occupied 111
words of Thorah have the Shekinah among theni‚’ where Taylor com-
pares Matt. xviii. :30 ‘there am I in the midst of them.'2
2. εἰς συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν.] Either ‘to a meeting of yours,' or ‘into your
,ssynagoguef the article being omitted according to Hellenistic use, as
*Ἴ 111 v. 20 ἐκ πλάνης αὐτοῦ. The word 15 used of 11 distinctively Christian
asseinbly hy Hei-inas Mand. xi. 9 (when a man having the Spirit of
God 0011105) εἷς συναγωγὴν ἀνδρῶν δικαίων ..καὶ ἔντευξις γένηται πρὸς τὸν
Θεὸν τῆς συναγωγῆς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων (there the power of the spirit 15
inanifestcd). In the note Harnack says that the word is used in the
earlier Greek only 111 active 501150 of ‘bringing together‚’ but by
,Jewish writers of the apostolic age (l) of the religious community, (2)
of the religious assenrbly, (3) of the place of assembly. It, alter-nates
with ἐκκλησία 111 the LXX„ but the latter 50011 became the predominant
and distinctive tei-111 among the Clu-isumus, συναγωγή being contrasted
wit-h it, as denoting an assembly of Jews 01· heretics, cf. Apoc. ii. t),
iii. 9 συναγωγή τοῦ Σατανᾶ, and many passages cited by Harnack from
Tertulliani, 1101111ου5, Clem. AL, Apost. Constitu. It seems however
that the (⁴hristi21n>⁴ of Judaea retained the wider use, after it had been
abandoned elsewhere, as Epiphanius xxx. 18 says of the Ebionites
συναγωγὴν οἷ’τοι καλοῦσι τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἐκκλησίαν καὶ οὐχὶ ἐκκλησίαν
(Lightfoot Philipp. 1). 190). lt 15 also found loosely used by other
Christian writers in the 501150 of ‘gatliering’ (ἐπισυναγωγή Heb. X-
