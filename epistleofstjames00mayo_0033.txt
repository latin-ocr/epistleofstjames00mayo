information on the subject of Clopas, but suggests that 116 may
possibly have been father of Mary. Later writers added further
developments to this theory. Clopas was identified with Alphaeus,
as another form of the common Aramaic original Chalphai3 and
‘Judas of James‚' who occurs in St. Luke’s list of the Apostles
(Luke vi. 16, Α615 1. 13), 15 identified with the writer of the.
Epistle, who calls himself ‘brother of James' (511(16 1), and also
with the brother of 50565, 5311165 and Simon in Mark vi. 3.
Simon Zelotes, who is joined with James and Judas in the list of
the Apostles, is supposed to be another of these brethren3 and
some held that Matthew, being identical with Levi the son of
Alphaeus‚ must belong to the same family.

Jerome and

in his comment on the Galatians written about 387 ΑΒ. 116 says : cssssssssistifilii-

‘James was called the Lord's brother on account of his high brhim-
character, his incomparable saith, and his extraordinary wisdom3
the other apostles are also called brothers (John xx, 17), but he pre—
eminently so, to whom the Lord at his departure had committed
the sons of his mother (161116 members of the Church at
Jerusalem) In a later work still, the epistle 10 Hedibia, written
about 406, he speaks of Mary of Cleophas (Clopas)‚ the aunt of our
Lord, and Mary 1116 mother of 5311165 and 50565, 35 distinct

persons, ‘although some contend that the mother of 5311165 and
5 0565 was his aunt.'
