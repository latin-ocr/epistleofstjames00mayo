clxxxiv THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

causative verb, we find the predicative noun preceding in i. 27
ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν, v. 10 ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε τῆς κακοπαθίας
v τοὺς προφήτας; the subject precedes in ii. 5 ὁ Θεὸς ἐξελέξατο
ποὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ πλουσίους ἐν πίστει, and in i. 18
ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἀπαρχήν. Sometimes an
adverbial phrase supplies the place of an oblique subject, as in
i. 2 χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε, which might
have been expressed χ. ἡνγ. πειρασμούς or τὸ πειρασμοῖς περι-
πεσεῖν; sometimes of an oblique predicate, as in ii. 1 μὴ ἐν
προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν, which might have been
expressed μὴ προσωπολημπτοῦσαν ἔχ. τ. π.

(4) The verb usually precedes the case it goverus unless the
speaker intends the substantive to be emphatic, asin ii. 14 τί
ὄφελος ἐὰν πίστιν Χένγῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ, where λένγῃ τις
intervening between πίστιν and its verb gives additional force to
the former. In this Epistle the verb precedes in 88 cases and
follows in 32, omitting relative clauses.
