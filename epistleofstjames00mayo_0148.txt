cxxiv THE EPls'rLE OF ST. JAMES

letters from the high priest to excite the authorities ot the
synagogues against the Christians. The tone used by St. James
in reference to the trials of the Christians does not imply‚ as the
tone of St. Peter would 500111 10 do, that the persecution was then
either at its height or immediately impending <1 Pet. iv. 12), but
rather to the sequel of a perseeution with its πειρασμοὶ ποικίλοι
of animosities exeited and losses endured, of liability to insults
and to interference with their religious services, as 111 Heb. x. 32.
If those addressed were still suffering under severe persecutions
we should have heard less of their petty rivalries and worldly
scheming. As to the position of St. ‹James in the Church of
Jerusalem, the first intimation we have of it is in Gal. i. 18, where
St. Paul mentions that he saw'him and St. Peter on his visit to
Jerusalem three years after his conversion. A more certain proof
of it may be found in Peter's message, sent to him on the occasion
of 1115 escape from prison in 44 A.D. (Acts xii. 17). Lastly the
picture given of the Church is not that of one just founded. A
circular letter cannot of course take note of the special circum-
stances of each individual congregation, and it 15 quite possible
and even probable that some of those addressed may have only
lately received the Gospel, but it 15 evident that the majority must
have been Christians of some years’ standing. Taking into
account these various considerations we may perhaps name the
year 40 A.D., as the earliest, and 50 A.D. as the latest, at which the
Epistle could have been written.

This is pretty much the conclusion which has been arrived at by
the majority of recent editors and others who have treated

1110111. This is the view of Schneckenburger (Annon. p. 138,

Eng. tr. 1842), Von Hofmann, Huther, Beyschlag (Comm. and
