STERNNESS or S'r. JAMES.

What are we to say to the stern denunciation of this passagel Is
it not inconsistent with the warning against judging and evil-speaking,
given in iv. 11 2 At any rate it is not inconsistent with the denun-
ciation of the Pharisees by John the Baptist and by our Lord. What
would be presumption in an ordinary Christian may be part of the
comlnission of a prophet. It was not presumption in J onah to declare
the approaching downfall of Nineveh ε the presumption came in, where
he expostulated with God for refusing to make good his threats, when
they had produced the desired effect. The prophetie announcement of
impending evil is not inconsistent with the tenderest sympathy, as is
shown by our Lord's lamentation over Jerusalem. Here We can see
ample reason for the strongest warning. The rich represented the
pride of the world. Their success, their triumphant career of selfish
oppression, while it left little hope of the possibility of their own
repentance, caused despair in the hearts of the brethren whom they
oppressed. It was the truest kindness on the part of the prophet to set
before both the fact of imminent judgment revealed to him by the Spirit.
To the rich it was the final invitation, the hand-writing on the wall,
which, if instantly accepted, might still enable them to seek a share in
the humiliation of a Christian (i. 10) 3 to the poor it was the encour-
agement needed to prevent their falling away. Nor is this prophetie
office yet extinct in the Church of Christ. VVherever sin is rampant,
wherever oppression and cruelty prevail, where the denunciation of the
evil-doei- is a dangerous and unpopular service, there the heart of the
prophet will still burn within him, till at the last he speaks with his
tongue.
