ΟΝ THE DATF„ OF THE EPISTLE cxliii

time: further, he is addressing the Chureh of Rome, which he
rightly assumes to be representative in its defects of the degeneracy
of the Church at large. Pfleiderer ridicules Schwegler’s identifica-
tion of tlie rich with Gentile, and tlie poor with Jewish Christians
(p. 872): hc explains ἔμφυτον correctly, in opposition to both
Schwegler and Briickner (p. 577). On tlie main point, however,
he holds to the Tiibingcn view, that tlic Epistle was written in th(¹
latter half of the second century, liis chief argument being that it
bears traces of being written after the Epistle 10 the Romans, the
lst of St. Peter, and Hermas.

I will not here repeat what I have said before as to the mutual
relations of the above-named Epistles, but will simply state the
general principles which I think ought to determine our judgment
in this and similar cases. Where it is agreed that there is a direct
literary connexion between two writers, A and B, treating of the
same subject from apparently opposite points of view, and using
the same illustrations‚ if it shall appear that the argument of B
meets in all respects the argument of A, while the argument of A
has no direct reference to that of B, the priority lies with A.
Again where it is agreed that there is a connexion between two
writers, treating of the same subject, on the saine scale, from the
same point of view, and using the same quotations, it is probable
that the writer who gives the thought in its most terse and rugged
form, and takes least trouble 10 be precise in the wording of his
quotations is the earlier writer. Using these tests, I venture to
think that it has been proved conclusively, that the Epistle of St.
J ames is prior to the first Epistle of St. Peter and to that of St. Paul
to the Romans ; and this one fact is sufficient to upset the whole
house of cards erected by Pfleiderer. Supposing however that the
priority of James to Paul were still a matter of doubt, I should
not be at all more inclined to admit the possibility of our Epistle
having been written at the late date assigned to it by Pfieiderer.
None of his arguments seems to me to be of such a nature as we
should rely on if it were a question about secular writers. Take
for instance his assertion that Hermas was prior to J ames. From a
literary point of view, this seems to ine on a par with saying that
Quintus Smyrnaeus is prior to Homer, or Apuleius to Cicero. But
on what does he ground the assertion? ‘ That which occurs in an
aphoristic form in James‚ is found in its natural context in
