and Ascension, the main point of the comparison (suffering) is omitted z
if it refers to the Cmcffixion, the encouragement is wanting. Moreover
if Κυρίου is to bear this force here, we should at least have expected
the article with it, and the writer in the preceding verse bid them
look to the prophets as their examples, not to Christ.

12. πρὸ πάντων δὲ μὴ ὀμνύετε] This is a reminiscence of our Lord’s
words (Matt. v. 34) in which, instead of the old rule οὐκ ἐπιορκήσεις, 116
lays down the Christian rule μὴ ὀμόσαι ὅλως...ὲ’στω δὲ ὁ λόγος ὑμῶν ναὶ

of the O.T. itself is not by any means uniforln on this subject. A Jew
might defend the use of oaths by appealing to Deut. vi. 13 (hidding-
the people swear by the name of God), Psa. lxiii. 11 ἐπαινεθήσεται πᾶς ὁ
ὀμνύων ἐν αὐτῷ, Isa. lxv. 16, Jer. xii. 16 (though in these passages it is
rather the faith‘ in Jehovah symbolized by the oath than the oath
itself which is meant) 3 also to the practice of Elijah (1 Kings xvii.
1), Micaiah (ib. xxii. 14), and the words ascribed (ἀνθρωπικώτερον, as
Athanasius says, ap. Suic. ii. p 513) to God himself, Gen. xxii. 16,
Psa. CV. 9, Isa. xl. 23, see particularly Heb. vi. 16 f., vii. 21. On the
