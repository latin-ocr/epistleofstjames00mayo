V 17-20 NOTEs 169

φαρμακείᾳ σου ἐπλανήθησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη. Τ110 passive aor. is used
with a middle force in classica] writers, as in the LXX. Deut. xxii.
1, Ps. cxix. 176, Ezek. xxxiv. 4, and probably m Luke xxi. 8 and
2 Pet. ii. 15 καταλείποντες εὐθεῖαν ὁδὸν ἐπλανήθησαν. It makes no
differ enee as to the admonition given, whethei the wander er goes
astray of his own will, or is led asti ay by otheis. See above 1.16 and
πλάνη ὁδοῦ just below.

ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας] See above i. 18, John viii. 32, 1 John i. 6, iii. 18,
19, 3 John 4 (I have no greater joy than to hear that my children) ἐν
ἀληθεία περιπατοῦσιν, ἯῙῘΞΕῙ. V. 6 ἐπλανήθημεν ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ ἀληθείας, Psa. CXIX.
30 ὁδὸν ἀληθείας ᾗρετισάμην.

ἐπιστρέψῃ τις] F ound with the same force Mal. ii. 6 πολλοὺς ἐπέστρε-
ψεν ἀπὸ ἀδικίας, Luke i. 16, 17, Acts xxvi. 18, Psa. lxxix. 3, Lam. v. 21,
Polyc. ad Phil. 6 οἱ πρεσβύτεροι εὔσπλαγχνοι...ἐπιστρέφοντες τὰ ἀποπε-
πλανημένα, Apost. Const. ii. 6 τοὺς πεπλανημένους ἐπιστρέφετε, Plu‘c. Mor.
21 (lVIenander) ἐπέστρεψε καὶ περιέσπασε πρὸς τὸ καλὸν ἡμᾶς. In Matt.
xiii. 15 and elsewhere it is used intransitively, much as the passive in
1 Pet. ii. 25 ἦτε γὰρ ὡς πρόβατα πλανώμενοι, ἀλλ’ ἐπεστράφητε νῦν ἐπὶ τὸν
ποιμένα καὶ ἐπίσκοπον τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν. The following τις shows that
this duty was not confined to the elders. As it belongs to the brethren
in common to pray for each other and hear each other's eonfessions, so
here they are in common exhorted to bring back wanderers to the saith.

20. γινώσκετε] So WH. with Cod. Β. The majority of the best
Mss. have γινωσκέτω, keeping the regular construction. The use of
the plural after τις ἐν ὑμῖν may be paralleled by μὴ δῶτε after τις ἐξ ὑμῶν
above (ii. 16). On the other hand it is possible that an original γινωσ-
κέτω may have been altered to suit ἀδελφοί μου. Reading γινώσκετε, Ι
should be inclined to treat it as an indicative (as in Matt. xxiv. 32,
John xv. 18), calling attention to the well known fact (like ἴστε 111 1.
19) that conversion involves salvation, rather than introducing it as
something of which they had to be informed. Or, if we follow the
other interpretation, and consider that we have here an appeal to
enlightened sels-interest, it may perhaps be thought more worthy of
St. J ames to mention this as 11 fact in which all are interested, than to
insist 011 it 115 a motive for the individual who takes in hand to convert
his brother.

ὁ ἐπιστρέψας ἁμαρτωλόν] Why 15 this iepeated? Some say in 01de1·
to emphasize the fact, but a more obvious reason would be that it is in
order to avoid ambiguity, especially if γινώσκετε 15 read. Withouss these
words the subject of σώσει would naturally be undeistood to be‘ one
of 0u.'

ἔκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ diffusa] Compaling Wlscl. Xil. 24 τῶν πλάνης ὁδῶν μακρό-
τερον ἐπλανήθησαν lonyius aberrabant quam eromoq is viae feo-ebant (‘ even
further than error itself’ ) we might be disposed to make πλάνης depend
on ὁδοῦ, translating‘ his erring path', but the usual 01de1 of words,
when the metaphorica] ὁδός 15 joined 'with a genos quality, 15 to put
ὁδός first, as in Psa. cxix. 29, 30 ὁδόν ἀδικιας ἀπόστησον ἀπ’ ἐμου.. ὁδόν
ἀληθείας ῃρετισάμην, Pl OV. iv. 24 66. εἰρήνης, ib. viii. 20 66. δικαιοσύνης
