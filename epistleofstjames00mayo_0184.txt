clx THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

phrase. Of (1) we have the following examples: τὸν τίμιον καρ-
πόν v. 7, τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς iii. 13, τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον i. 213
of (2) τὴν ἐσθῆτα τὴν λαμπράν ii. 3, τῇ φύσει τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ iii. 7,
6 νομοθέτης ό δυνάμενος iv. 12, ταῖς ταλαιπωρίαις ὑμῶν ταῖς
ἐπερχομέναις v. 1, 6 μισθὸς τῶν ἐργατῶν τῶν ἀμησάντων τὰς
χώρας, ὁ ἀφυστερημένος v. 43 of (3) ἀδελφὸς 6 ταπεινός (so B) i. 9,
νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας i. 25, ἀτμίς ἐστε ἡ πρὸς ὀλίγον
φαινομένη iv. 14, where the article makes the tendeney to appear
and disappear a quality of the vapour, and not a mere accidental
circumstance; so in Heb. vi. 7 γῆ γὰρ ἡ πιοῦσα, ix. 2 σκηνὴ
κατεσκευάσθη ἡ πρώτη; of (4) we have τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τοῦ
σώματος ii. 16, τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως iii. 6, ἡ φιλία τοῦ
κόσμου iv, 4, ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντος iii. 4. The loose construe—
tion (4) is more usual than the compact (1) in St. James and
the N.T. generally, especially where a pronoun is concerned, as
τὸ ἄνθος αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ (very rarely the compact, as
in i. 18 τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων,1 Phil. ii. 30 τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα);
sometimes the gen. precedes, as in iii. 3 τῶν ἵππων τοὺς χαλινούς,
V. 12 ἤτω ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναί, 1 Tim. iv. 14 ἵνα σου ἡ προκοπὴ
φανερὰ ᾗ. The loose construction also prevails in long or complex
phrases, cf. iv. 1 τῶν ἡδονῶν τῶν στρατευομένων ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν,
where the more idiomatie form would have been τῶν ἐν τοῖς
μέλεσιν στρατευομένων ἡδονῶν, and i. 5 παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ
πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς, where we might have expected either π. τοῦ Θεοῦ
τοῦ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς διδόντος, 01· π. τοῦ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς διδόντος Θεοῦ ;
so i. :3 τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως might have been more eom-
pactly expressed τὸ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν δοκίμιον. Classical parallels
will be found in the note on i. 5. We find the eompact construction
however in iii. 9 τοὺς καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν Θεοῦ γεγονότας and frequently
in both Epistles of Peter, as in the First i. 14 ταῖς πρότερον ἐν τῇ
ἀγνοίᾳ ὑμῶν ἐπιθυμίαις, ii. 9 τοῦ ἐκ σκότους ὑμᾶς καλέσαντος,
ii. 15 τὴν τῶν ἀφρόνων ἀνθρώπων ἀγνωσίαν, iii. 2 τὴν ἐν φόβῳ
ἁγίαν ἀναστροφὴν ὑμῶν, V. 1 6 καὶ τῆς μελλούσης ἀποκαλύπ-
τεσθαι δόξης κοινωνόςῑ in the Second i. 4 τῆς ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ἐν τῇ
ἐπιθυμία φθορᾶς, ii. 7 τῆς τῶν ἀθέσμων ἐν ἀσελγείᾳ ἀναστροφῆς,
ii. 10 τοὺς ὀπίσω σαρκὸς ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ μιασμοῦ πορευομένους.

¹ This shows that Α. Buttmann, p. 102 (cited in VViner p. 193 n.)‚ is wrong in his

limitation, ‘The insertion ofthe persoual pronoun occurs in Paul only, and with no other
pronoun than ὑμῶν.’ Cf. also 1 Joh. ii. 27 τὸ αὐτοῦ χρίσμα, 1 Th. ii. 19, Rom. iii. 24.
