51 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

implics tho accompanying generosity of spirit. Dr. Taylor notes (J. Qf
I’lze'lologsys, vol. xviii. p. 299 foll.) that Hermas has borrowed the word
δώρημα (Mami. 2 and Sim. ii. 7). Philo's distinction is further borne
out hv thu fact that δώρημα 111 the only other passage in which it occurs
in NT. (Rom. v. 16) is used of a gift of God, and so δωρεά, wherever
it, occurs (John iV. 10, Acts ii. 13, viii. 20, x. 45, xi. 17, Rom. V.
15, 17, 2 Cor. ix. 11, Eph. iii. 7, iv. 7, Heb. vi. 4); δῶρον is mostly
used of offerings to God. Again δόμα is always used of human gifts
except in a quotation from LXX. ἔδωκε δόματα τοῖς ἀνθρώποις (Eph. iV. 8) ;
but δόσις, which, like ποίησις below, v. 25, strictly means the act (as in
Phil. iv. 15, the only other passage in N.T. εἷς λόγον δόσεως καὶ λήμψεως,
Sirac. 32. 9 ἐν πάσῃ δόσει ἱλάρωσον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου, ib. 20. 9), iS used
equally of God in Sir. 1. 8 Κύριος ἐξέχεεν σοφίαν κατὰ τὴν δόσιν αὐτοῦ, ib.
v. 15 δόσις Κυρίου παραμένει εὐσεβέσι, ib. 32. 10 δὸς Ὑψίστῳ κατὰ τὴν
δόσιν αὐτοῦ. Thus δωρεά and δώρημα are always used in the higher
sense, δόμα (with one exception) in the lower, while δόσις may have
either sense. We might take as examples of δόσις here, the gradual
instilling of wisdom, of δώρημα, the final crown of life. The choice of
the epithets ἀγαθή and τέλειον is also in agreement with Philo's distinc-
tion 3 compare for the latter Clem. Al. Paed. 1. 6, p. 113 τέλειος ὢν τέλεια
χαριεῖται δήπουθεν, Ρ11110 M. 1, p. 173 ὁλόκληροι καὶ παντελεῖς αἱ τοῦ
ἀγεννήτου δωρεαὶ πᾶσαι.

ἄνωθέν ἑστιν.] WH.‚ Ewald, Bouman, Hofmann, agree with the
Vulg. desursum est, descendeus α patre luminum in separating ε’στίν
from καταβαῖνον. Alf„ with the majority of commentators, takes them
together (= καταβαίνει), referring to 111. 15 οὐκ ἔστιν αὕτη ἡ σοφία ἄνωθεν
κατερχομένη, 011 which see n. There is no doubt that the Hellenistic
usage admits of their being taken together, cf. Mark xiii. 25, where οἱ
ἀστέρες ἔσονται πίπτοντες = πεσοῦνται Matt. xxiv. 29 3 Luke ix. 14, where
ἐν τῷ εἶναι προσευχόμενον = ἐν τῷ προσεύχεσθαι V. 27 3 ib. v. 16 αὐτὸς ἦν
ὑποχωρῶν ἐν τοῖς ἐρήμοις, V. 17, ἢν διδάσκων. For this extension of the
periphrastic tense, itself merely an instance of the analytic tendency
which marks the later stage of language, see Winer, p. 437, A. Butt-
mann, p. 264 foll„ where many cases are given, Arist. Met. iv. 7 οὐδὲν
διαφέρει τὸ ἅνθρωπος βαδίζων ἐστὶν τοῦ ἅνθρωπος βαδίζει. On the whole
Ι think the rhythm and balance of the sentence is better preserved by
separating ἐστι from καταβαῖνον. The construction will then be the same
aS is found in John viii. 23 ὑμεῖς ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστέ· ἐγὼ δὲέκ τῶν ἅνω εἶμί, and
implied below iii. 17 ἡ δὲ ἄνωθεν σοφία ἁγνή ἐστιν. For ἄνωθεν cf. John
3. 31, where it is equivalent to ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ immediately afterwards,
Xon. Syrus). vi. 7 (οἱ θεοὶ) ἄνωθεν μὲν ὕοντες ὠφελοῦσιν, ἄνωθεν δὲ φῶς
παρέχουσιν, Philo M. 1, p. 645 Ἰσαὰκ διὰ τὰς ὀμβρηθείσας ἄνωθεν δωρεὰς
ἀγαθὸς καὶ τέλειος ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐγένετο.

καταβαῖνον ἀπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς τῶν ᾠῶτων.] Explains ἄνωθεν, jUSb aS ἐκ τῶν
ἡδονῶν explains ἐντεῦθεν 111 iv. 1 below. The comparison of God to the
sun, and of his influence to light, is found both in Jewish and in
classical writers : for (1) see Malachi iv. 2 ἀνατελεῖ ὑμῖν τοῖς φοβουμένοις
τὸ ὄνομά μου ἥλιος δικαιοσύνης, Psa. xxxv. 9, Isa. IX. 1, 19, 20, 1 John
i. ἴ), Apoc. xxi. 23, Wisd. vii. 26 (σοφία) ἀπαύγασμά ἐστι φωτὸς ἀϊδίου,
