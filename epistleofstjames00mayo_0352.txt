92 THE EPISTLE OF* sT. JAMEs

1 Cor. iv. 18 ως μη ἐρχομέιου δέ μου, ev en the fifth occurs in 1 John 11. 2
οὐ περὶ τῶν ὑμετέρων δὲ μόνον. In Justin M. Apol. ii. 8 we find an
example of the Sixth pl: 109, καὶ τοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν Στωικῶν δὲ δογμάτων.

τὰ ἐπιτήδεια. τοῦ σώματος.] Only here in N .1., frequent in classical
authors, eg. Thuc. viii. 74 ὅσα περὶ τὸ σῶμα εἷς δίαιταν ὑπῆρχεν ἐπιτήδεια,
Theophr. Char. xi. 5 φειδωνίῳ μέτρῳ μετρεῖν αὐτὸς τοῖς ἔνδον τὰ ἐπιτήδεια
(their portions or rations).

17. ή πίστις...νεκρά ἐστιν] The absence of works, the natural fruit of
faith, proves that the faith is in itvself lifeless, just as a compassion
which expends itself in words is only counterfeit. Life cannot remain
latent. Of. Plaut. Epid. i. 2. 18 quid te ‘retulit beneficum esse oratione si
ad rem <masnilium emortuum est ,7 For metaphorical use of νεκρός, nearly
= μάταιος 1. 2. 6, or ἀργός below ver. 20, cf. below ver. 26, Heb. vi. 1
ancl ix, 14 ἔργα νεκρά, that is, ‘works done apart from the vivifying
influence of saith and love, with a view to earn salvationss cf. above
i. 26 n. and John XV. 4); Rom. Vii. 8 χωρὶς νόμου ἁμαρτία νεκρά, ‘Sin
13 dormant till roused into activity by antagonism to law'3 Epict.
Diss. iii. 23. 28 ἂν μὴ ταῦτα ἐμποιῇ <via produce conviction of error)
ὃ τοῦ φιλοσόφου λόγος, νεκρός ἐστι καὶ αὐτὸς καὶ ὁ λέγων.

καθ’ ἑαυτήν.] Not a mere repetition of ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα; the absence
of fruit shows that it is not merely outwardly inoperative but inwardly
dead.

18. ἀλλ’ ε’ρεῑ ns] ‘ Nay, one may say, Thou hast faith and Ι works 3
do thou, if thou canst, prove thy saith without works and I will prove
mine by my wor.ks ² It has been shown that faith without wor'ks 13
of no value: one may,D Ο·0 fur ther and say that its existence is incapa—
ble of proof. The 11111301, with 1113 usual modesty, puts himself 111 the
backgromffl, does not claiin to be the representative of perfect working
saith, but supposes another to speak. Usually the phrase ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις
13 used of an objection, like νὴ Δία, αι enim, as 1 Cor. xv. 35 ἀ.ἐ.τ. πῶς
ἐγείρονται οἱ νεκροί ,· and in classic-al Greek Xen. Cyon iv. 3. 10 ἀλλ’
ἐρεῖ τις ἴσως ...ἀλλ’ εἴποι ἄν τις, and so some would take it here: ‘ It
may be objected that works and faith are different forms of genuine
religion : your form may be faith, mine works, both equally acceptable
in the sight of God.’ The explanation is untenable, because it makes
the imaginary objector treat the writer us though it was the latter
who was exalting saith above works, instead of the opposite. In the
text ἀλλά has a strengtheninu force = immo, like πλήν 111 Matt. xxvi.
(54, cf. John xvi. 2 ἀποσυιαγώγους ποιήσωσιν ὶμᾶς· ἀλλ’ ἔρχεται ὥρα ἵνα
πᾶς ὃ ἀποκτείνων ὑμᾶς δόξη λατρείναι προσφερειν τῷ Θεῷ,14111ζθ xvii. 8,
ἀλλ’ οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτω,· (11111011 I think should be transl ated‘ nay! will he
not 1··1.th(1·say unio him'l’ ) 2 Cor. vii. 11 πόσην κατειργάσατο ὑμῖν
σποιδηι, ἄλλα dvrosxoyifflav ἀλλὰ αγανιὶκτη,σιν ἀλλὰ φόβον, κ.τ..,λ Phil. i.
15’ εν τοι τῳ χαίρω· ἄλλα. καὶ χωρήσομαι, 1101). iii. 16 τίνες πα[)επικραναιν; ἀλλ’
οὐ πάντες, with Alf'. 3 n. Instead of the future the optative with* αν
would bc more common in classic-al Greek, but the latter form is rather
avoided by the Hellenistic writers, ocem-ring only eight times in N.T.
(thricc in Luke, five 1111103 111 Acts), see A. Buttmann, p. 188, who cites
Rom. V. 7 μόλις γὰρ ὑπὲρ δικαίου τις ἀποθανεῖται, &tn In Latin the
