98 THE EPISTLE OF ST. ,1Λ M‘Es

neighbonr. 'l‘he great importancc of the text in (len. xv. is that it is
the first passage in which the ‘ law of liberty ' is laid down. Definite
set tasks irrespective of motives are exacted from slaves: in the family
of God the motives of the children are the 11111111 thing in the eyes of
the Father. Here the right state of mind is declared to be in God’s
sight eqnivalent to the right action, though, as St. James says,
right action is the necessary result of the right feeling and it is only
through right action that the right state of mind can be evidenced to
others, so that the absence of right action (unless precluded by special
circumstances) is 11. proof that the state of mind is not right. The faith
of Abraham is the same as the trust which is so often declared blessed
in the Psalms, eg. Ps. ii. 12, xxxiV. 8.

φίλος Θεοῦ ε’κλήθη.] The precise words¹ are not found in the LXX. 111
Gen. xviii. 17, where our version simply has ⁶ Shall ,Ι hide from
Abraham that thing which l do'ss’ the LXX. has οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἀπὸ Ἀβ.
τοῦ παιδός μου ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, which is quoted by Philo (Sobr. M. 1, p. 401)
with the words τοῦ φίλου μου, though elsewhere (Leq. All. M. 1, p. 03)
he cites it without alteration. In 2 Chron. xx. 7 ‘Art thou not our
‹40d who...gavest it (the land) to the seed of Abraham, thy friend, for

εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, Vulg. semim? Abraham musici ἰαί, Isa. xli. ὅ ⁴ the seed of
Abraham my friend' is in LXX. σπέρμα Ἀβραὰμ ὃν ἠγάπησα.1 The
appellation is still in use among the Arabs, ‘ with whom the name of
Khalil Allah (the friend of God), or more briefly El Khalil, has
practically superseded that of Abraham. Even Hebron, as the city os
Abraham, has become El Khalil ’ (Pluinptre in loc.) Clem. Rom. has
the phrase twice, probably copying from St. J ames (i. 10 ὁ φίλος
προσαγορευθείς with Lightfoot's n. and 17), and so Irenaeus iv. 16, 2
Abi-aliam, credidit Deo ec reputatum est illi ad justitiam ec amicus Dec
focacios est. Compare John xv. 14, 15, Wisd. vii. 27 (σοφία) εἷς ψυχὰς
ὁσίας μεταβαίνουσα φίλους Θεοῦ καὶ προφήτας παρασκευάζει, Taylor’s JAE'.

Jews. She was countcd as one of the four chief beauties‘, the others
being Sarah, Abigail‚ Esther, and was said to have been the ancestress
of eight prophets (Meuschen, p. 40). She is also cited :is 1111 example
