TO WHOM THE EPISTLE IS ADDRESSED cxv

and the ensuing raid on the Church (Acts viii. 1, ix, 1, 2, 21) 3 1 at
Antioch in Pisidia it was the higher class of proselytes who were
51111611 up by the Jews 10 expe] Paul out of their coasts (Acts
xiii. 50).

It is easy to understand this hostility of the richer and more
powerful Jews to the Ohristians. The prosperous and well-to·do
are naturally suspicions of reformers : and Christ and His disciples
were reformers of a very thorough-going kind. They preached
that the kingdom of heaven was for the poor, that it was easier for
a camel 10 go through the eye of a ncedle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven. The rich man who would enter
therein must no longer count his 1161165 1115 own 3 116 1111151 5611 all
that 116 had and give 10 1116 poor; he must glory no longer in
wealth and station, but in having learnt that his superiority only
marked him out as intended by God to be the minister and servant
of all (James i. 10, Mark x, 43, 44). But there were other and
more special grounds for the hatred entertained by the chief priests
and Pharisees for the name of Christ. On two separate occasions
Christ had openly denounced the buying and selling which was
carried 011 in the Temple under 1116 sanction and for the profit of
1116 worldly-minded and avaricious priests and their partisans: in
his parable of the Vineyard and the Husbandmen he had 'prophe-
sied their speedy overthrow; and St. Luke concludes his narratives
of the two incidents in much the same words, ‘The chief priests
and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him '
(Luke xix. 47, xx. 19, 20). Even more scathing was his de-
nunciation of the intellectual aristocracy‚ ‘VVoe unto you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites.' As 116 had weighed humble poverty in
the balance against sels-satisfied wealth, so he weighed modest
ignorance against sels-satisfied learning in the words ‘ I thank thee,
Ο Father, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent and hast revealed them unto babes'; and even went so
sar as to declare that the publican and harlot were nearer to the
kingdom of God than the sels-righteous Pharisee. Yet again, the
Sadducees' disbelief in the resurrection was directly challenged by

¹ ‘ The members of the new sect being striet observers of the law and agreeing with
the Pharisees in their opposition to the Sadducees, appeared in a favorable light to
at least the more moderate of the former‚’ until the opposition of the Gospel to
Pharisaic ι111111115111 found definite expression in the teaching of the Hellenistic
