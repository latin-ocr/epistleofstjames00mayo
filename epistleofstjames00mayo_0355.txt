20. θέλεις δὲ γνῶναι] Cf. Rom. Xiii. 3 θέλεις δὲμὴ φοβεῖσθαι; τὸ ἀγα-
θὸν ποίει. The question is equivalent to a condition ⁶ if you wish for a,
conclusive proof that faith by itself cannot save, take the case of
Abraham? It would seem that from this point St. J ames speaks again
in his own name.

ὦ ἄνθρωπε κενέ.] Cf. Rom. ii. 1 ὦ ἄνθρωπε πᾶς ὃ κρίνων, iX. 20 ὦ
ἄνθρωπε, μενοῦνγε σὺ τίς εἷ,· 1 Tim. Vi. 11 ὦ ἄνθρωπε Θεοῦ. Κενός ( = Raca)
is defined (Epiet. Εἴθε. iv. 4. 25) as one ἐφ’ οἷς οὐ δεῖ ἐπαιρόμενοςῑ like
‘canus it is usesl of a man who cannot be (lepencled on, whose deeds (lo
not correspond to his words, hence of boasters (Soph. Ant. 703 οὗτοι δια-
πτυχθέντες ὤφθησαν κενοί) and impostors‚ joined with ἀλαζων Plut. rit.
p. 581 F. Perhaps the words in Hermas Mand. xi. 3 αὐτὸς κενὸς ὢν
κενῶς ἀποκρίνεται κενοῖς· ὃ γὰρ ἂν ἐπερωτηθῇ πρὸς τὸ κένωμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
ἀποκρίνεται may refer to our text: cf. Didache 2. 5 οὐκ ἔσται ὁ λόγος
σου ψευδής, οὗ κενός, ἀλλὰ μεμεστωμένος πράξει. Hilgenfeld and others
who suppose this argument on saith and works to be directed against
St. Paul imagine that St. Paul himself is here addressed. See lntro-
duction.

ἀργή.] Nem-ly τ- νεκρά, which is read here by some MSS„ cf. 2 Pet.
i. 8 ταῦτα (love, brotherly-kindness, 4310.) οὒκ ἀργοὺς οὐδὲ ἀκάρπους καθίσ-
τησιν, Matt. xii. 36 πᾶν ῥῆμα ἀργόν.

21. Ἀβραὰμ. ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν.] This was the constant title of Abraham, as
is shown in Matt. iii. 8, John viii. 33 foll„ Luke xvi. 24, Rom. iv. 1,
16. Its use favours the supposition that the epistle is addressed
principally to Jews.

οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ;] The ca se of Abraham was naturally appealed
to as the pattern of saith not by St. Paul only (in Rom. iv. and Gal.
iii. 7, where we find the same quotation as in our next verse), but in
Heb. xi. 8 and 1 Maec. ii. 52 Ἀβραὰμ. οῧχὶ ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστὸς καὶ
ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἷς δικαιοσύνην, ib. xliv. 20 foll„ VViSd. X. 5, see Light-
foot Galatiam&⁷ p. 151 foll. WVhen the example of Abraham was abused
as assui-ing justification to all who professed an orthodox belief, it was
equally natural to shOW‚ as St. James has done, that Abraham's saith
was not a mere profession but an extremely active principle. Clement
of Rome combines the views of St. James and St. Paul: see i. 10, 31,
τίνος χάριν ηὖλογήθη Ἀβ. ,· οὐχὶ δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἀλήθειαν διὸ. πίστεως ποιή-
σας,· ib. 33 with Lightfoot’s notes, and above ver. 14 n. For ἐξ ἔργων
see ver. 18 and Matt. Xii. 37 ἐκ τῶν λόγων δικαιωθήσῃ. Δικαιόω iS
strictly to make 213. pr01ounce just, like ἀξιόω to pronounce or (leem
worthy or fitting, cf. Exod. xxiii. 7 οὐ δικαιώσεις τὸν ἀσεβῆ, 1 Kings
viii. 32 δικαιῶσαι δίκαιον, δοῦναι αὐτῷ κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ, Psa.
cxliii. 2 οὐ δικαιωθήσεται ἐνωπίον σου πᾶς ζῶν, ]sa. XIV. 26 ἀπὸ Κυρίου
δικαιωθήσοικται...πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, Acts Xiii. 39, Rom. iii.
28 λογιζόμεθα δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς ἔργων νόμου, ib. iv. 1 εἷ
Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ἔχει καύχημα, Habak. ii. 4 quoted in Rom.
i. 17. See Τ. S. Evans on 1 Cor. vi. 11.

ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαάκ] Cf. Gen. viii. 20 ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν
...ἀνήνεγκεν εἷς ὃλοκάρπωσιν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, 1 Pet. ii. 5, Ηθ1). vii.
27 ἀι αφ θυσίας, where XVestcott distinguishes it from the Classical term
