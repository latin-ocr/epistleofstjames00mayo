illustrates it from Phil. iii. 19 ὡν ἡ ὃόξα’ εν τῇ αἰσχύνῃ αὐτῶν. But ταπεινω-
σις 11ον01· bears this sense in the Ηο1101115110 writers. It and 115 cogn 01ος
are used either 10 0 good sense morally (as below iv. 6, 10), 01 of mere out-
ward humiliation (as in Luke 1. 48 ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης
αὑτοῦ, Sir. 2. 5 ἅνθρωποι λεκτοὶ δοκιμάζονται ἐν καμίνῳ ταπεινώσεως, ib. xi. 13,
xx. 10, Psa. cxix. 50, 67, 71, 1 Mace. iii. 51, 2 Sam. xvi. 12, Neh.
iX. 9). In the next place such a change of mood in the verb 10 be
supplied is extremely harsh, and 1 think Alf. stands alone in supposing
it possible. Equally impossible is the supposition of Oecumenius,
Grotius and others that some such word as αἰσχυνέσθω 01· ταπεινούσθω
should be supplied. However we understand πλούσιος, 110 interpreta-
tion is admissible which does not supply the imperative καυχάσθω.
Bede, followed by Huther and Beyschlag, has attempted to reconcile ³
this with the idea of πλούσιος, 05 an unbeliever, by giving it a sarcastic
force, ‘ let the rich man, if he will, glory in his degradation.’ It must
be allowed that such bitterness of sarcasm is not impossible in the
writer of ii. 19, iv. 4, v. 1-63 but could he so early in his letter, in
cold blood so to speak, have thus anathematized the rich as a class,
when we know from iv. 13-16 that some of those to whom he writes
were wealthy tradem? How could one who had known Nicodemus
and Mary of Bethany, J oseph of Arimathaea and Barnabas, have thus
denied to the rich the privilege of Christian membership‘l According ·
to the correct interpretation all that lie does is to repeat his Master's
warning in Matt. vi. 19 foll„ xvi. 26, Mark X. 24, Luke xii. 15-21,
xvi. 9-31 3 50 St. Paul l Cor. vii. 29-31, cf. Herm. Sim. ii. 4 foll.

ὅτι ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου παρελεύσεται.] A quotation (given more fully
10 1 Pet. i. 24) from Isa. xl. 6 πᾶσα σὰρξ χόρτος καὶ πᾶσα δόξα ἀνθρώπου
ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου· ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος καὶ τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσενε cf. Psa. lxxxix.
6, 0111. 15. It 15 evident that this 15 not a special threat intended
only for the rich, but a general truth applicable to all, though more
likely to be kept out of sight by the rich than by others. ‘Let him
glory in that which the world holds to be humiliation, but. which is
indeed the commencement of everlasting glory, because he must soon
pass away from earth and leave behind the riches in which he 15 now
tempted to glory.’ Pliny NH. 21. 1 has the same comparison, Floras
odoresque in diem 92'9922‘8 (natura) mayolo. admonitione hominum, quae
spectatissime floreant celerrime marcescere.

παρελεύσεται.] Used in this sense, as well in common, as in Hellenistic
Greek: Cf. Mark Xiii. 31 ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ παρελεύσεται. It is not
necessary to understand 0 new subject πλοῦτος from πλούσιος, though it
is possible that the equivalent phrase in the LXX. δόξα ἀνθρώπου may
have been in the writer’s mind3 but the rich man 05 such, whether
believer 01 unbeliever, must quickly clisappear, and, like the flower, lose
