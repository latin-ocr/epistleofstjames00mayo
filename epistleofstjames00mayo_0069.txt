THE AUTHOR xiv

Leaving this subordinate point, the facts wc have been consider-

ing are certainly confirmatory of the belief that St. James was essnmsl 0

really our Lord's brother, and not only so, but that he grew up
under 1115 Brother's influence, and that his mind was deeply
imbued with his Brother's teaching. How then are we to ex-
plain 1116 fact that at a later period ‘he did not believe on him '2

I have given what seems to me the general explanation on p. xxiii.
foll„ but, after reviewing the particular points in which we have
definite proof of agreement from the Epistle written by St. J ames
long after he had enrolled himself among the disciples‚ we may
perhaps gather from its silence a confirmation of what we might
have suspected on general grounds, that 0116 01 1115 character of
mind would find a difficulty in accepting some of the utterances 01
Christ. ‘Before Abraham was, I am‚' ‘Except ye eat the flesh
of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no 1116 111 yon,'—
these must have been ‘hard sayings ² to the brother of Jesus even
111016 than to strangers. It is highly probable that his saith may
have been shaken by the absence of any sign from heaven to
announce the inauguration 01 the tempora] reign of the Messiah.
We can imagine also that he may have found a stumbling-block
in our Lord's severity towards the reli gious leaders of the time and
his tenderness shown to publicans and sinners, so unlike the
Psalmist's declaration ‘ Ι will not know a wicked person,' ‘I hate
thern with a perfect hatred.'

This state of mind, while perhaps not incompatible with the belief

in Christ’s mission as a preacher of righteousness‚ and a willingness con

to accept him as the anointed King of the Jewish people, might
easily lead to an anxious solicitude as to his sanity, and the prudence
of the measures he took forextending the number 01 1115 adherents.
Yet underneath this anxiety there must have always been on the
part of the brothers an intense love and reverence for Jesus, a
suspicion that, after all, 11 it were only practicable, His course was
a nobler‚ simpler course than that which they themselves sug-
gested3 just as the friends 01 Socrates felt when he refused to
follow their counsel and escape from prison. I do not quite
understand Bp. Lightfoot's saying that the circumstances of the
Crucifixion were such as ‘to confirm rather than dissipate the former
unbelief.’ If Crito and the other friends of Socrates felt that his
death had added a crown 01 glory to his life, and raised affection
