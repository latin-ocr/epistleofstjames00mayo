DID ST. JAMES WRITE IN GREEK ΟΒ ARAMAIC? ccix

able objection to a similar use of the adverbial phrase. In any
case the difficulty would not be lessened by the supposition of its
being a translation from Aramaic. On the whole we may sasely
say that the general impression produced by a study of the Greek
is much in favour of its being an original.

But can we suppose that the son of a Galilean carpenter would
have been capable of writing such idiomatic Greek? We have
seen above (p. xli.) that Galilee was studded with Greek towns,
and that it was certainly in the power of any Galilean to gain a
knowledge of Greek3 even if he were, as Prof. Neubauer holds,
brought up in ignorance of any language but Aramaic‚ and not, as
Prof. T. K. Abbott is inclined to believe, speaking Greek as freely
as Aramaic.1 We know also that the neighbouring town of Gadara
was celebrated as an important seat of Greek learning and litera-
ture, and that the Author of our Epistle shows an acquaintance
with ideas and phrases which were probably derived, mediately or
immediately, from the Stoic philosophers.2 If we call to mind
further that he seems to have paid particular attention to the
sapiential books, both canonical and apocryphal, and that a main
point in these is to encourage the study of ‘the dark sayings of
the wise'; that the wisdom of Edom and Teman is noted as
famous by some of the prophets,3 and that the interlocutors in
the book of Job are assigned with probability to this and neigh-
bouring regions 3—taking into account all these considerations, we

Teaets of the Old and Now Testamenta p. 162, where he argues that the inhabitants
of Palestine at the time of the Christian era were bilingual, and illustrates the
occasional use of Aramaic by our Lord from the parallel case of lrish phrases in the
mouth of Irishmen who habitually speak English. The Rev. G. H. Gwilliam,
whom Ι 11311 consulted as to the relation of the language of the Peshitto to Aramaie,
writes that ‘he prefers to speak of the vernacular of I’alestine, rather than to use
the term Aramaic,’ because 1110 vernacular of Palestine in the first century of the
Christian era ‘included many dialects, some of which were extremely corrupt. In
centres os Jewish life and influence, Ι believe a knowledge of Hebrew was cul-
tivated. · 111 Samaria we know from the literary remains that a form of Chaldee was
spoken. in Galilec, it appears that the common tongue was a very 1111Χο11 dialect,
and according to 'Deutsch (R emerius, Tho Talmud, p 42) Palestinian patois was a
mele jar.gon Amongst these many fbrms of speecli Ι find no place for Syliac pro-
perly so called. The lano guage of the Peshitto was the language of Edessa. It
was closely related to Chaldee and Samalitan, and indeed not very far removed,
after all, from Hebrew. It is a curicus question, which Iam not prepared 10 answer,
whether one who habitually spoke one of these dialeets‚ could easily understand a
speaker in another of them. I suspect there were considerable dill'crences of pro-

nunciation which are now lost for ever.'
