The next difficulty is the meaning of κόσμος here. Isidore of Peluv
sium (st. 400 A.l›.), followed by the Greek (·01nmentat01·S, mentions
two meanings (l) ⁸‹›1·11;11n011t,' ἐγκαλλώπισμα δοκεῖ τῆς ἀδικίας, because
the longui& κοσμεῖ τὴν ἀδικίαν διὰ τῆς τῶν ῥητόρων εὖγλώττου δεινότη-
rog: so Elsncr, watstein, Semler, Storr, Ewald. and othei-:53 (2) ‘ the
wicked world '2 at, least this seems to be intended by the somewhat
obscure expressions πῦρ ἐστι, πλῆθος ἀδίκως κατακαίουσα, and κόσμος ἐστὶ
τῆς ἀδικίας, οἱονεὶ πρὸς τὸν συρφετώδη ὄχλον καὶ δημώδη ἐκφερομένη καὶ
βλέπουσα, with which apparently should be connected the sentence just
below, ταύτῃ γὰρ ἀλλήλοις κοινωνοῦμεν τῶν ἑαυτῶν νοημάτων. The majority
however of modern commentators follow the Vulgate ‘ universitas
iniquitatis' (3), thus explained by Bede, ‘Quia cuncta fere facinora
ster eam aut concinnantur . . . auc patrantur . . . aut defenduntur)
So Erasmus, Calvin, Corn. a Lapide, Schnecken burger, Kern, De Wette,
NViesinger. Alford, Beysehlag, Erdmann. The objection to (3) is, that
St.. ‚J ames elsewhere only uses the word κόσμος in a bad sense (i. 27
ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου, ii. 5, iv· 4 ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου ἔχθρα
τοῦ (θεοῦ ἐστίν) 3 that only one example in all Greek literature is addueed
for the meaning ‘ totality,’ viz. Prov. xvii. (i τοῦ πιστοῦ ὅλος ὁ κόσμος
τῶν χρημάτων, τοῦ δὲ ἀπίστου οὐδὲ ὀβολός, if indeed this should not be
rather understood more literally of the inanimate world, as consisting
of things which can be used and enjoyed. Lastly, the article seems
scarcely consistent with this interpretation. ⁶ A world of cares ’ is a
natural expression for many cares 3 but if we say ‘ the world of care,'
we are understood to predicate something about the world itself.
Schegg's interpretation, ‘ the sphere or domain of iniquity‚’ is, I think,
an improvement on (3) as far as sense goes, but it is not the natural
meaning of κόσμος. The objections stated above are also applicable in
part to (l). It is moreever a very harsh expression to call the tongue
⁸ the ornament of injustice ’ because it is capable of being used to give
a eolour to injus-tice 3 and it falls flatly after the strong-er word ‘ fire.’

Putting aside the eommentators. if we read the words simply we ean
hardly fail to be reminded of the similar expressions in Luke xvi. 8, 9
τὸν οἰκονόμον τῆς ἀδικίας, τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας, where τῆς ἀδικίας is
qualitative, as is shown by the parallel expression in ver. 11, τῷ ἀδίκῳ
μαμωνᾷ (cf. i. 17 above). The meaning of the phrase will then be ‘in
our mierocosm the tongue represents or constitutes the unrighteous
world' which is probably the meaning of the version in the Speculum,
mundus iniquitatis per linquam constat in membris vesl‘ris : cf. 1 John
v. ll) ὁ κόσμος ὅλος ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ κεῖται, and below iv. 4.¹ In the
same way it might he said ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκὸς ὁ γαστὴρ καθίσ-
ταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν. The tongue represents the world, because itis
that member by which we are brought into communication with other
metr: it is the organ of society, the chief ehannel of temptation from

¹ [Ι think the force os tlu· expression is better brought out if we explain τ. ἀδικίας
as a posscssive genitive, ‘the world whi‹·h is under the dominion of unrighteousness,'
i.e. thc world as converted hy our diseascd imaginatione into an opaque looking-
glas-s l'or sellishnvss, instead of :1 window sor thc view of God. Compare Rom. vi.
