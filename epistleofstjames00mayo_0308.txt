to evil 3 Le. our boues in God's own character, His perfect purity and
holiness, makes it impossible for us to suppose that it is from Him
that. our temptations 1 weced.

πειράζει δὲαύτὸς οὐδένα] The δὲ with αὐτός contains an opposition to
ἀπει’ραστος; ‘so far from himself tempting others to evil, which would
imply a delight in evil, he is by his own nature incapable of being
even solicitcd to evil.' For the difficulties connected with this subject

14, ἕκαστος δὲ πειράζεται ὑπὸ τῆς ἰδίας ἑπιθυμίας.] Wetsb. quotes Mena.-
choth f. 99. b (slightly shortened) caro et sanquis seducit a viis vitae
cvl vias mortis: Deus (ι viis mortis ad vias vitae. We may compare
the famous words of Plato αἰτία ἑλομένου· Θεὸς ἀναίτιος Rep. X. 617;
also Plzaedr. 238 (ἐπιθυμίας ἀλόγως ἑλκούσης ἐπὶ ἡδονὰς καὶ ἀρξάσης)
this tyranny of lust was called ὕβρις, Cleanthes <Stob. Ecl. i. 2. 12)
οὐδέ τι γίγνεται ἔργον ἐπὶ χθονὶ σοῦ δίχα, δαῖμον, πλὴν ὁπόσα ῥέζουσι κακοὶ
σφετέρῃσιν ἀνοίαις...αὐτοὶ δ’ αὖθ’ ὁρμῶσιν ἄνευ καλοῦ ἄλλος ἐπ’ ἅλλα κ.τ.λ,,
Chrysippus ap. Gell. 6. 2. 12 3 above all the discussion on the voluntary
nature of virtue and vice in Arist. Eth. iii. 5. See also Philo M. 2.
p. 349 τὸ ἀψευδῶς ἂν λεχθὲν ἀρχέκακον πάθος ἐστὶν ἐπιθυμία, ib. 208
ἀδικημάτων πηγὴ ἐπιθυμία ἀφ’ ἧς ῥέουσιν αἱ παρανομώταται πράξεις, ib.
M. 2. p. 204 (in contr-ast with other affections which may be deemed
involuntary) μόνη ἐπιθυμία τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐξ ἡμῶν λαμβάνει καὶ ἐστὶν ἑκούσιος.
It is these ἐπιθυμίαι σαρκός, as they are frequently called, which consti-
tute ‘ the law in our members ' (Rom. vii. 23). St. J ames describes them
below (iv. 1) as ἡδοναὶ ‘ warring in our members.' As ἐπιθυμία is here
personified, there is no question about the use of ὑπό, on which see below
iii. 4 n. For ἰδίας cf. 2 Tim. iv. 3, 2 Pet. iii. 2, Jude 18, 19.

φύσιν οὐκ εὐάλωτον, Plato Tim. 69 ἡδονὴν, μέγιστον κακοῦ δέλεαρ, Isocr.
