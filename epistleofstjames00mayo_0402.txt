142 THE EPIS‘rLE OF ST. JAMES

εἰδέναι.. ,αμαρτια ἐστιί, or ὃ εἷδὼς“ αμαρτιαν ἔχει, as in John IX. 41 εἲ τυφλοὶ
ητε οἰκ ἂν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαι, il). XV. 22, 24, 1 John 1. 8. For the dative

xxhele 866 Alf„ Clein. Rom. 44 ἁμαρτία οὗ μικρὰ ὑμῖν ἔσται ἐὰν.
ἀποβάλωμεν, Herzln 18 lis. iii. 3 τί μοι ὄφελος ταῦτα ἑωρακότι καὶ μὴ
γιιωο-κοιτι (where, as her,e the infinitive would haue been 618161· than
the participle). 'she phrase’‘ εσται σοι (01 ἔν σοι) ἁμαρτία iS common
in LXX„ eg. Deut. XV. 9, xxiii. 21, 22, xxiv. 153 also ἁμαρτίαν
λαμβάνειν Lev. xix, 17, xxii. 9, xxiv. 15, so Rom. xiv. 20 πᾶν δὲ ὃ οὐκ
ἐκ πίστεως ἁμαρτία ἐστί.

For the pleonasm of αὐτῷ 61. John XV. 2 πᾶν κλῆμα μὴ φέρον
καρπὸν αἴρει αὐτό, Μ att. iV. 16, Apoc. 11. 7 τῷ νικῶντι δώσω αὐτῷ
φαγεῖν, esp. after a relativ ·6, as ‚Mark vii. 25 γυνὴ ἧς εἶχεν τὸ θυγά-
τριον αὐτῆς πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον, very common in LXX., as Exod iv. 17
ῥάβδον’ εν ᾑ ποιησεις ἐν αὐτῇ τα σημεῖα, Amos. iv. 7 μερὶς ἐφ’ ἢν οὔ βρεξω
ἐπ αὐτην ζηρανθήσεται, see Winer p. 184, who gives inst: moes from
61ι18816ι11 Greek. Examples of the infinitive after οιδα ln this sense are
found in 2 Pet. ii. 9, Matt. vii. ll. The word καλόν 18 common with
St. James (ii. 7, iii. 13) as with St. Paul (Rom. vii. 18, 19, 21, 2 Cor.
xiii. 7, Gal. vi. 9, where the phrase ποιεῖν τὸ καλόν occurs). The anar-
throus neuter occurs in the similar phrase πᾶς ποιῶν πονηρόν Mal. ii. 17.
For the thought see Luke xii. 47, John ix. 41, Philo M. 2. p. 518 τῷ
μὲν ἀγνοίᾳ τοῦ κρείττονος διαμαρτάνοντι συγγνώμη δίδοται· ὁ δ’ ἐξ ἐπιστήμης
ἀδικῶν ἀπολογίαν οὐκ ἔχει. The appeal to knowledge here, as above
i. 19, is a proof that the writer is addressing Christians.

V. 1.—It is a question whether the rich here addressed are Christians
or not. That there were rich members of the Chureh appears from i. 10,
ii. 2, iv. 13 and St. Paul's wal-nings against the love of riches. On the
other hand ‘the brethren' in V. 7 seem to be opposed to ‘the rieh'
here, and the prophets, whom St. James imitates, did not confine
their thr eats and war nings to Israel : we have the burden of Moab and
Egypt as well as of Israel. If we suppose the words uttered first of all
with reference to disbelieverS, they will still be applicable to all who
111( any respect follow ln their footsteps.
