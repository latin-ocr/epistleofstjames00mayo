56 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

nipe, :nul used with an ellipsis of the substantive verb.’ In 1 Cor. vi.
5 οὐκ ἔνι ἐν ὑμῖν οὐδεὶς σοφός the word has a weaker force, as often in
Plato, Xen., irc.

παραλλαγή] Only here in N.T. 3 used of mental aberration in LXX.
ἐν παραλλιιγῇ ‘ furiously¹ 2 Kings ix. 205 of the succession of beacon-
ligius, Assum. 490. Its general sense is the same as that of the
v. πιιραλλάσσω, denoting variation from a set course, rule or pattern,
as in Plut. Mor. 1039 B, Epict. Diss. i. 14 (referring to the changes of
tho sensons) πόθεν πρὸς τὴν αὔξησιν καὶ μείωσιν τῆς σελήνης καὶ τὴν τοῦ
ἡλίου πρόσοδον καὶ ἄφοδον τοσαύτη παραλλαγὴ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἐναντία μεταβολὴ
τῶν ἐπιγείων θεωρεῖται 3 hence it is used for difference, as ib. ii. 23. 32
μηδεμίαν εἶναι παραλλαγὴν κάλλους πρὸς αἶσχος. Some commentators
have thought it to be a vom teclzm'ca of astronomy = παράλλαξις, our
‘parallax‚' but no instance of such a use is quoted. It is true it is a
favoni-ite word with the asti-onomer Geminus (contained in Petavius'
Uwuuspfflw), but he uses it quite generally of the varying length of the
day, «ke. ; cf. p. 26 Β ἀκολουθεῖ δὲ τούτῳ καὶ παραλλαγὴν τῶν ἡμερῶν μεγά-
λην γίνεσθαι διὰ τὴν τῶν τμημάτων ὑπεροχὴν ὧν φέρεται ὃ ἥλιος ὑπὲρ γῆν (i.e.
the length of the day varies according to the sun's elevation). Other
instances are cited by Gebser p. 83. We may therefore take the word
to express the contrast between the natural sun, which varies its
position in the sky from hour to honr and mouth to month, and the
eternal Source of all light. A similar contrast is found in Epict. Diss.
i. 14. 10 ἀλλὰ φωτίζειν μὲν οἷός τε ἐστὶν ὁ ἥλιος τηλικοῦτον μέρος τοῦ
παντὸς, ὀλίγον δὲ τὸ ἀφώτιστον ἀπολιπεῖν, ὅσον οἶόν τ’ ἐπέχεσθαι ὑπὸ σκιᾶς
ἦν ἡ γῆ ποιεῖ· ὁ δὲ καὶ τὸν ἥλιον αὐτὸν πεποιηκὼς καὶ περιάγων, μέρος ὅντ’
αὐτοῦ μικρὸν, ὡς πρὸς τὸ ὅλον, οὗτος δ’ οὔ δύναται πάντων αἷσθάνεσθαι;

τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα] The AV. ‘shadow of turning‚’ though supported
by the Old Latin modicum obumbrationis and by the Greek commentators
and lexicographers and by Ewald in modern times, is undoubtedly wrong.
The simple word σκιά may take this colloquial sense, as in Philo Μ.-1. p.
606 πεπιστευκὼς ἴχνος ἢ σκιὰν ἢ ὥραν ἀπιστίας δέχεται, Demosbh. 552. 7 εἴ
γε εἶχε στιγμὴν ἦ σκιὰν τούτων, but it is impossible that this should be fehe
case with a ἅπ. λεγ. like ἀποσκίασμα. The cognate ἀποσκιασμός occurs
Plut. Paria-c. 6 γνωμόνων ἀποσκιασμούς of the shadows thrown on the
dial, ancl ἀποσκιάζω Plato Rep. vii. 532 O. Taking the word by itself we
naturally understand it of an eclipse, where the sun is hidden by the
shadow thrown off from the moon. Denying this of God is in effect
ngivident to l John i. 5 ὁ Θεὸς φῶς ἐστὶ καὶ σκοτία ἐν αὐτῷ ου’κ ἔστιν
ου εμια.

The word τροπή is only found here in N.T. ; it is used of the
heavenly movements in LXX. Deut. xxxiii. 14 καθ’ ὥραν γεννημάτων
ἡλίου τροπῶν, Job. xxxviii. 33 ἐπίστασαι τροπὰς ου’ρανοῧ, also in Wisd.
vii. 18 (God gave me to know) σύστασιν κόσμου καὶ ἐνέργειαν στοιχείων,
τροπῶν ἀλλαγὰς καὶ μεταβολὰς καιρῶν, ἐνιαυτοῦ κύκλους καὶ ἀστέρων θέσεις,
where it has its usual technical meaning ‘ solstices.’ The RV„ in agree-
ment with Gebser, XViesingen Alf„ Beyschlag‚ Erdmann‚ translates
‘ shadow that is cast by turning,' which Alf. explains as referring to ‘ the
revolution in which the lie-avens are ever found, by means of which the
