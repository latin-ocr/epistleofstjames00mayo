θέλημα ἀνδρός John i. 13, οὗ γὰρ θελήματι ἀνθρώπου ἠνέχθη προφητεία
1 Pet. i. 21. The choice of οἶνήρ here, instead of ἄνθρωπος, was probably
determined by the facts of the case3 the speakers would be men, and
they might perhaps imagine that there was something manly in violence
as opposed to the feminine quality of πραΰτης, cf. Longin. ,S'ublim 32
τὴν μὲν τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν οἴκησιν προσεῖπεν ὡς γυναικωνῖτιν, τὴν τοῦ θυμοῦ δὲ
ὥσπερ ἀνδρωνῖτιν, Clem. Al. Strom. iii. p. 553 P. θυμὸν μὲν ἄρρενα ὁρμήν,
θήλειαν δὲ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν. The word οἶνήρ is used of men in conti-ast to
gods in Homer's phrase πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε. Here the thought that
it is God's righteousness brings out the absurdity of man's hoping to
effect it by mere passion.

δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ.] Already in the O. T. we find ri ghteousness described as
the attribute and gift of God z Isa. xlv. 24, liv. 17, lxi. 10, 11, Jer. xxiii.
6, xxxiii. 15, 16, Dan. ix. 7, Hos. X. 123 and in Micah vi. 5 ἡ δικαιο-
σύνη τοῦ Κυρίου is declared not to consist in sacrifices but in doing
justice and leving mercy. This is more clearly expressed in Matt.
V. 20, Vi. 33, Rom. i. 17 δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ (the Grospel) ἀποκαλύπ-
τεται ἐκ πίστεως εἷς πίστιν, ib. iii. 5, 21 foll.‚ X. 3 ἀγνοοῦντες τὴν τοῦ
Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην καὶ τὴν ἰδίαν δικαιοσύνην ζητοῦντες στῆσαι, τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ
τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐχ ὑπετάγησαν. What St. J ames understood by the phrase
was no doubt (1) the perfect obedience to the law of liberty contained
in the Sermon on the Mount (see below ver. 25, ii. 8, 12) as distin-
guished from that outward observance which constitutes righteousness
in the eye of man, and (2) the acknowledgment that such righteousness
was the gift of God, wrought in us by His word received into our hearts
(above ver. 5, 18, iii. 17). We may compare the phrase δίκαιοι ἐνώπιον
τοῦ Θεοῦ Luke i. 6 (of Zechariah and his wife), Acts iv. 19, viii. 21,
1 Pet. iii. 4, dcc. See Vorst Hellen. p. 399 foll„ 649 foll.

ἑργόζεται.] So κατεργάζεται ὑπομονήν ver. 3, τῷ ποιήσαντι ἕλεος ii. 13,
ἐργαζόμενος δικαιοσύνην Acts X. 35, Heb. Xi. 33.

ἀποθέμενοι οὖν πᾶσαν κακίαν...τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα ἐπιποθήσατε. It is a
metaphor from the putting off of clothes, as in Heb. xii. 1 (stripping
for the Pace), Rom. Xiii. 12 where ἀποθώμεθα τὰ ἔργα τοῦ σκότους is
opposed to ἐνδύσασθαι τὰ ὅπλα τοῦ φωτός, Eph. iv. 22 where ἀποθέσθαι
τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον is opposed to ἐνδύσασθαι τὸν καινὸν ἄνθρωπον, Col.
