III 13-18 WJSDOM 209

Epistles and elsewhere, the counterparts of the Jewish rabbis, men
fluent and positive and argumentative, who arrogated to themselves
the name of wise. St. James says nothing as to the extent of their
learning or knowledge 3 he is content to point out those particular
characteristics of heavenly wisdom in which they were manifestly
deficient. We cannot argue from this that he would have disapproved
of elaborate disquisitions on theologica] questions such as we read in
the Epistle to the Hebrews, or that he would have condemned the
pul-suit of learning or scienoe for its own sake 3 but for the present his
mind is fixed on praetio-al issues.

IV. 1—17. Paraphrase.

The real sonrce of ozor qnarrelsomeness is the yreediness with which
each one yrasps at pleasnrc for himself. W e are envions, if we see
others saeeeed where we have failed .· (ind we are consciens that cnr
whole life is a fail‘are, as it always must be, ‘when nien either omit to
pray, or pray only for worldly objeets whereby to yratisy their selfish
impulse& Bat those who sech the world's favour ean never obtain the
favour of God. The two are absolutely incompatible. As the Serip-
t‘a‘re says, ‘the Spirit which He has planted in ‘ns jealonsly lonqs for
oar love.’ It is owing! to this jealons affection that Hc resiste the
prend and ¹qivee yrace to the hnmble. If we snbvnissively accept His
chastisetnent and retnrn to Isi-vn, Hc will return to ns, and the tconpter,
who offers the world to each of ns, as he did to Christ, will flee from
us also, when he finds wc arc determined to misc him. This we must
do by rcnonneiny all wiched actions and chcelciny cdl evil thoagjhts, by
learninq to tahe a serious view of life, yiviny up our thonyhtless
mirth, practisiny sels-denial and repentance, monrniny over sin and
hnmblinq ourselves before God. If we thas tarn from the world to
God, He will raise ns up and [soma ns a share in His hinqdom.

Do not thinh‘ liyhtly of ill-natitred yossip. To spealc ayainst a
brother or to condemn a brother is really to speah aqainst and con-
demn the law of God, who has bidden ns to love one another, and has
9iven a special warninq ayainst this sin in the words, ‘ Jndye not,
that ye be not jndyed? Shall we venture to set up onr opinion ayainst
God’s law, and elaion to do that which has been distinctly forbidden
by the sole Lawyiver and Jndye ? Onr duty is not to criticiza bat
to obes.

A further characteristic of thc spirit of worldliness is ea‘hibited in
cnr confident forminss of plcans for the fntnre, without any thoussht

of the preearions nature of eart'hly enjoyment, and of cnr dependenee
