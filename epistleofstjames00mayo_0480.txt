220 COMMENT

that, as far as we can judge‚ it was never contemplated by St.
James, and that there is no evidence of its use during the first
eight centul-ies by any except an obscure sect of Gnostics. There
are others who, while allowing that the belief in spiritual benefit to
be derived from Exti-eme Unction is a mere unauthorized fancy, are
still inclined to wink at it, as a means of tranquillizing the mind and
preserving it from terrors as unreal and as superstitious as the remedy.
If a false theology has fastened on the mind the belief that God’s mercy
is limited to this life, and that after death He has no further compassion
for the sinner who has not repented and believed while on earth, but
is henceforth only the Judge and the Avenger, is it not allowable to
drive out one error by another? The question is far-reaching, but no
lover of truth can hesitate. Even at the last hour let the true Gospel
sound in the ears of the dying penitent‚ still more of the dying saint,
who is terrified by suspicions that he has not the right faith Orthe
true conversion. He who has once grasped the idea that Christ is
the propitiation for the sins of the whole wor1d3 that God’s mercies
arc everlasting over all His creatures 3 that He will do for each after
death exactly what perfect love and perfect wisdom dictate 3 that
Eternal Jiistice and Eternal Holiness‚ no less than Eternal Love, are
our gual-antee against an eternity of evil, will have no need and no
wish for a material anointing.

CONFEssmN or Sm.

The connexion between suffering and sin was universally believed in,
and even exaggerated, when St. J ames wrote3 as is evident from our
Lord’s words about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with the
sacrifices, and also from the question of the disciples about the man
who was born blind. St. Paul asserts that many were punished with
sickness and even with death for irreverence in receiving the Eucharist.
The J ewish proverb quoted in my note to the effect that ‘ a inan could
not recover from sickness till his sins were forgiven' is quite in
accordance with our Lord’s procedure in healing the sick of the palsy,
where the words ‘Son‚ thy sins are forgiven thee’ preceded the
command ‘Rise up and walk' 3 and both enable us to understand why
confession and forgiveness are introduced here in the instructions
given for the healing of the sick.

There seemS, however, to bc a certain want of consecutiveness
in the language of St. James. We should have expected the con-
fession of sins to be mentioned before the forgiveness of sins, and
even before the prayer for healing‚ since heading, as we have seen,
was regarded as implying forgiveness 3 whereas it is brought in
afterwards as a second thought, though connected with what pre-
cedes by the inferential particle οὖν. The emphatic ἀλλήλοις and
ἀλλήλων of v. 16 are decisive against the Romish limitation of
confession to the priest. Either the Elders mentioned in v. 14
have no special position distinguishing them from the other members
of the Church, or, more probably, we are to suppose that the duty
