ἀσυντάκτῳ, Psa. xxxii. 9, xxxix. 1, cxli. 3. For thought 500 ver. 19,
and below iii. 1—10.

ἀπατῶν καρδίαν {av-rofi] We should rather have expected this to come
in the apodosis: ‘if any one thinks himself religious and yet does not
bridle his tongue‚ he deceives himself and his religion is vain.' lf
included in the protasis it would have been more logically expressed
by εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρῆσκος etune„ μὴ ὢν, ἀλλ’ ἀπατῶν κ.τ.λ. For the general
μὴ ὢν the writer substitutes that positive failing which he took to be the
cause of this unreality. The phrase ἀπ. καρδ. 15 equivalent to παραλογι-
ζόμενοι ἑαυτούς above ver. 22, cf. Rom. xvi. IS διὰ τῆς εὐλογίας ἐξαπα-
τῶσι τὰς καρδίας τῶν ἀκάκων, Gral. Vi. 3 εἰ γὰρ δοκεῖ τις εἶναί τι, μηδὲν ὤν,
ἑαυτὸν φρεναπατᾷ, 1 Cor. iii. 18 μηδεὶς ἑαυτὸν ἐξαπατάτω· εἴ τις δοκεῖ
σοφὸς εἶναι ἐν ὑμῖν μωρὸς γενέσθω κ.τ.λ., Test. Nephth. p. 6⁴38 Fubr. μὴ
σπουδάζετε ἐν λόγοις κενοῖς ἀπατᾶν τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν, ὅτι σιωπῶντες ἐν καθαρό-
τητι καρδίας δυνήσεσθε τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ κρατεῖν, Hatch, p. 98.

μάταιος] Cf. τί ὄφελος below ii. 14. Here With two terminations, as
in Tit. iii. 9, but with three in 1 Cor. xv. 17, 1 Pet. i. 18, 500 NViner,
p. 80: for thought cf. Isa. i. 10-17, Isocr. (αἱ Nz‘coc. p. 18 Ε ἡγοῦ θῦμα
τοῦτο κάλλιστον εἶναι καὶ θεραπείαν μεγίστην ἐὰν ὡς βέλτιστον καὶ δικαιότατον
σαυτὸν παρέχῃς.

27. καθαρὰ. καὶ ἀμίαντος.] Often found together, as in Herm. Sim. v. 7
τὴν σάρκα φύλασσε κ. καὶ ‘iffi-² Philo 2 M. p. 249, Dion. ]{al. 11.]ι’. viii.
43, 52 κ. καὶ ἀμ. ἔχειν συμβήσεται τὴν ψυχὴν ἀπὸ παντὸς χόλου. Erasmus Σ
Purus est apud Jmlaeos qui morticinium uon contiqlt, qui lotus sit
vivo flumine...2'mpu7·us est qui carnem suillam ederit.

παρὰ. τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Πατρί.] The heavenly standard is appealcd to here
115· above vor. 20 δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ, 1 Pet. ii. 20 τοῦτο χάρις παρὰ Θεῷ,
and below ε’νώπιον Θεοῦ iV. 10. The phrase ὃ Θεὸς καὶ Πατήρ is used below
iii. 9 according to some MSS„ and by St. Paul 1 Cor. xv. 24, Eph. v.
20, also with ἡμῶν added 1 Thess. i. 3, iii. 11, 13, Gal. i. 3, Phil. iv.
20. Θεὸς πατήρ 15 found Rom. i. 7, 1 Cor. i. 3, Eph. i. 2, &Q ὁ Θεὸς
πατήρ Col. i. 3, iii. 17, where see Lightfoot, ] Pet. i. 2 ὁ Θεὸς καὶ Πατὴρ
τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰ.Χ., Rom. xv. 16, 2 Cor. i. 3, &Q

αὕτη ἐστίν, ἐπισκέπτεσθαι] For the attraction of τοῦτο 'to αὕτη See
MadV. Gr. ξ 98 ‘a demonstrative pronoun to which a substantive is
attached as predicate-noun by εἰμί ὥσ. is apt to assume the gender and
number of the substantive, Xen. Oecon. 8. 2 αὕτη πενία ἐστὶ σαφής, τὸ
δεόμενόν τινος μὴ ἔχειν χρῆσθαι] For the explanatory infinitive in appo-
sition to αὕτη cf. WViner, p. 663 foll. The verb 15 used of visiting the
sick in Matt. xxv. 36, 43, Sirac. vii. 35, and in classical Greek, as·
Xen. Cyon v. 4. 10, viii. 3. 25.

ὀρφανοὺς καὶ χήρας.] God is called the father of the fathcrless and
judge of the widow Psa. lxviii. 5 3 there is a special curse on those who
afflict the fatherless and widow Dent. xxvii. 193 the Pharisees arc
charged with devouring widows' houses (Luke xx. 47); cf. Exod. xxii. 22,
Job. xxxi. 16, 17, Simo. iv. 10 γίνου ὀρφανοῖς ὡς πατὴρ καὶ ἀντὶ ἀνδρὸς τῇ
’μητρὶ αὐτῶν. We find descriptions which recall many of the feature>⁴ of
this passage in Barnab. XX. 2 χήρᾳ καὶ ὀρφανῷ οὐ προσέχοντες...ὧν μακρὰν
καὶ πόρρω πραΰτης καὶ ὖπομονή...οὖκ ἐλεῶντες πτωχόν, εὐχερεῖς ἐν καταλαλίιιι,
