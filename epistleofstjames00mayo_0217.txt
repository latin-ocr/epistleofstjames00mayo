ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF ST. JAMES cxciii

words is concerned, St. James is more idiomatic than the other 1
canonical writers, and for the rest that he uses with freedom rare ·
words and compoundS‚ all of them correctly formed and some of
them possibly formed by himself. He is however a purist in ,V
reg-ard to those combinations of prepositions and adverbs which are ι
50 marked a feature of late Greek, eg. ὑπερλίαν 2 Cor. xi. 5, ἐφάπαξ :³
Heb. vii. 27, ἐκπάλαι 2 Pet. ii. 3, ἀπὸ τότε Matt. iv, 17, ἀπὸ πέρυσι j
2 Cor. viii. 10, cf. Winer, p. 525.

Another point deserving notice'in St. James, which might seem
to denote limited acquaintance with the language, is his use of ι
general instead of special terms; though, as regards ποιεῖν and *s*
διῇἱνῖιιῖνοϊπ (Hebrspp. {384163 167, 59) considers that this
extended use is derived from the corresponding Qwords.

cf. ποιητὴς λόγου 1. 22, ποιητὴς νόμου iV. 11, ποιητὴς ἔργου
i. 25.

ἂν (ὁ καρπὸς) λάβῃ προίμον V. 7, ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε τοὺς προφή-

I go on now to speak of the style of the Epistle, as exhibited in
the writer's use of rhetorical figures and of rhythm. Though
1116110 not find here the oratorical power of the epistle to the
Hebrews or the rapid and impassioned eloquence of St. Paul,
though there 15 110 attempt to build up a number of sub-
ordinate clauses into elaborate periods3 yet there is something
too of rhetorical skill, and at times of idiomatic phraseology
which is very telling. The sentences are short, simple, direct,[
conveying weighty thoughts in weighty words, and giving thei
