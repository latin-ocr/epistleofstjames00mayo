ΙΙΙ 11-13 ΝΟΤΕ8 117

stantive and the subject of δύναται ποιῆσαι. The true relation of the
sentences is lost by the insertion οὕτως. The two clauses are not com-
pared with each other, but are both used to illustrate the impossibility
of genuine worship proceeding from a heart which naturally vents itself
1n cui-ses.

13. τίς σοῲὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν ς] The interrogative here takes· the
place of a condition, as in Luke xi. ll τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει
ὁ υἱὸς ἄρτον,· μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ,· and ib. 5-8, where the construc-
tion is broken, τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἔξει φίλον being changed into a regular con-
ditional form in ver. 8 εἰ καὶ οὗ δώσει διὰ τὸ εἶναι φίλον, διά γε τὴν ἀναίδειαν
αὐτοῦ δώσει αὐτῷ, Dent. XX. 5-8 τίς ὃ ἄνθρωπος ὃ οἰκοδομήσας οἰκίαν καινὴν
καὶ οὐκ ἐνεκαίνισεν αὐτήν ,· πορευέσθω...καὶ τίς ὃ ἅνθρωπος ὅστις ἐφύτευσεν
ἀμπελῶνα καὶ οὐκ εὐφράνθη ἐξ αὖτοῦ; πορευέσθω κ.τ.λ., J ud. vii. 3 τίς ὃ
φοβούμενος καὶ δειλός ,· ἐπιστραφέτω, Psa. XXXiii. 12 τίς ἐστιν ἅνθρωπος ὁ
θέλων ζωήν ,· παῦσον τὴν γλῶσσάν σου ἀπὸ κακοῦ, ib. cvii. 43 τίς σοφός ,·
καὶ φυλάξει ταῦτα καὶ συνήσει τὰ ἐλέη τοῦ Κυρίου, 183.. l. 10 τίς ἐν ὑμῖν ὃ
φοβούμενος τὸν Κύριον ,· ὖπακουσάτω τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ, Jer. 1Χ.
12, Hos. XiV. 10, Sir. Vi. 33 τίς σοφός ,· αὐτῷ προσκολλήθητι, other
examples in Vorst, p. 211 foll. For a similar use without the inter-
rogative pronoun see n. on V. 13 κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν ,· προσευχέσθω.
Lachmann has no interrogation here, and A. Buttmann (p. 217) argues
on the same side, comparing it With other instance& in which he thinks
τίς is equivalent to an indefinite relative 3 but the passages cited above
are sufficient to settle the question. The abruptness to which Buttmann
objects is a marked characteristic of the writer-’s style. For ἐν ὑμῖν
almost equivalent to ὑμῶν cf. below v. 13, 14, and ἐξ ὑμῶν above ii. 16.
Ἐπιστήμων here only in N.T., it occurs in Deut. i. 13 (of judges) δότε
αὐτοῖς ἄνδρας σοφοὺς καὶ ἐπιστήμονας καὶ συνετούς, ib. iv. 6 (Of Israel) ἵδου
λαὸς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων, ISa. V. 21 οὐαὶ οἶ συνετοὶ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ ἐνώπιον
αὐτῶν ἐπιστήμονεςῑ used in classical Greek for a skilled or scientific
person as opposed to one who has no special knowledge or trainiug.
Compare for thought and expression Philo M. 2. p. 421 τίς γὰρ οὐκ ἂν
εἴποι ὅτι σοφὸν ἄρα γένος καὶ ἐπιστημονικώτατον μόνον τοῦτ’ ἔστιν, ᾧ τὰς
θείας παραινέσεις ἐξεγένετο μὴ κενὰς καὶ ἐρήμους ἀπολιπεῖν τῶν οἶκειῶν
πράξεων ἀλλὰ πληρῶσαι τοὺς λόγους ἔργοις ἐπαινετοῖς ,’

δειξάτω ἑκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς τὰ ἔργα. αὐτοῦ.] Cf. above ii. 18. The
noun is derived from ἀναστρέφομαι = L. versor, as in 1 Pet. i. 17, 2 Pet.
ii. 18, Prov. XX. 7, and frequently in Polybius with adverb. It occurs
often in both epistles Of St. Peter, eg. 1. 15 ἅγιοι ἐν πάσῃ ἀναστροφῇ
γενήθητε, 1. 18 ἐλυτρώθητε ἐκ τῆς ματαίας ἀναστροφῆς, 111. 2 τὴν ἐν φόβῳ
ἁγνὴν ἀναστροφήν, 111. 16 τὴν ἀγαθὴν ἐν Χριστῷ ἀναστροφήν, 2 ep. ii. 7,
iii. 11, SO in Tobit. iV. 14 ancl Polyb. iv. 82, 1 κατὰ τὴν λοιπὴν ἀναστροφὴν

τεθαυμασμένος, see Hatch, p. 9. Καλός occurs in this epistle ii. 7,
iv. 17, καλῶς, ii. 3, 8, 17: the former is joined with ἀναστ. in 1 Pet. ii.
12. For the general sense cf. Sir. xix, 18 πᾶσα σοφία φόβος

Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ ποίησις νόμου· καὶ οὐκ ἔστι σοφία πονηρίας
ἐπιστήμη κ.τ.λ., Clem. Rom. i. 38 ὃ σοφὸς ἐνδεικνύσθω τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ
μὴ ἐν λόγοις ἀλλ’ ἐν ἔργοις ἀγαθοῖς. Here the simpler expression would
have been, as De Wette remark& δειξάτω...τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ, like ii. 18
