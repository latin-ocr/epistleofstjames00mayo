To WHOM THE EPIsTLE Is ADDREssED cxiii

when he wrote. St. Peter (i. 1) confines himself to the Diaspora
of Asia Minor. His Epistle‚ as we have seen, was drawn up with
a distinct reference to that of St. James, which in some respects
served as a model for his own. It seems natural therefore to

ἶ suppose that one reason why it was addressed to these particular

provinces of the Diaspora was that they were less likely to be ac· ’
quainted with the Epistle of St. J ames than the provinces omitted.
It is also probable that the name Diaspora would be understood to
refer, in the first instance, to the original Eastern Diaspom, settled
in Babylon and Mesopotamia, and extending as far as the eastern
and northern borders of Palestine. J osephus tells us that 1115
Ηίεέοφῃ of the Jewz‘sh War was first written in Aramaic and
addressed τοῖς ἄνω βαρβάροις, whom he afterwards explains to
be the dwellers in Parthia, Babylonia, Arabia, Adiabene, and the
countries on the other side of the Euphrates (B. J. Po'ooem. i. 2),
but that subsequently he translated it into Greek for the benefit
of the Romans (Ap. i. 9). It is also noticeable that these eastern
provinces are the ones first named in the list given of the foreign
Jews who were present at the feast of Pentecost (Acts ii. 9—11).
We know that there were Christians in Damascus and Antioch
at a very early period (Acts ix. 2, 10, 14, 19, 25, xi. 19-21), as
well as in Cyprus and Phoenicia (Acts iv. 36, xi. 19, 20). St.
Peter writes from Babylon (v. 13), which is probably to be under-
stood literally of the city on the Euphrates and the surrounding
district. An early legend represents a King of Edessa corre-
sponding with our Lord and welcoming the mission of the apostle
Thaddaeus (Euseb. H. E. i. 13).

We will now see what more is to be learnt in regard to the
readers of the Epistle from the Epistle itself. J ames writes to them
as being himself a servant of Jesus Christ (i. 1), and he assumes
that they hold the faith of Christ (ii. 1), and recognize that they
are no longer under a yoke of bondage but under the perfect law of
liberty (i. 25, ii. 12). They are mixed up however with men who
are not only unbelievers but who blaspheme the name of Christ
and persecute the believers (ii. 6, 7). Τ110 believers themselves
are mostly poor (ii. 5) 3 the few rich belonging to their body (i. 10)
are in danger of falling away through covetousness, worldliness
and pride (iv. 3-6, 13-16). The rich generally appear as perse-
cutm-s and oppressors, keeping back the hire of their labourers,
