14ss THE EPISTLE oF ST. JAMES

ἐπαμησάμενος; 111 its 00111111011051·1 sense of reaping or mowing, getting in
the harvest, the active voice 15 used as 111 Homer ll. xviii. 551 ἔριθοι
ἤμων ὀξείας δρεπάνας ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες, ὥ. xxiv. 451 λαχνήεντ’ ὄροφον
(rceds) λειμωνόθεν ἀμήσαντες, Herod. vi. 28 ἀμ. σῖτον, Arist. lffq. 392 ἀμ.
θέρος. Τ110 word θερίζειν 15 rather more common for reaping and
hal-vesting, and 15 given as a synonym of ἀμᾶν by Hesych. Both are
used alike of the reaping of corn (ἀμ, 111 Lev. xxv. 11, Dent. xxiv. 19,
Isa. xvii. 5) and the mowing of grass (θερ. 111 Ρ5. cxxix. 7). Both are
used also in a metaphorica] sense of cutting sheer off, as in Hes, Tlceoy.
181 (of Cronos mutilating his father) ἤμησε, Soph. Aj. 239 (of Ajax)
’γλῶσσαν ῥίπτει θερίσας.

τὰς χώρας ὑμῶν,] Used here of a field, plot of ground, like χωρίον in
Acts i. 18, iv. 34, xxviii. 7, and in classical writers. So we find Lnke
xxi. 21 οἱ ἐν ταῖς χώραις, ib. xii. 16 ἀνθρώπου τινὸς εὐφόρησεν ἡ χώρα,
John iv. 35 θεάσασθε τὰς χώρας ὅτι λευκαί εἶσι πρὸς θερισμόν, Evang.
Thomae c, 12 ἵνα σπείρῃ σῖτον εἷς τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν. 111 Α11105 iii. 9, x.
11 it stands where the A.V. has ‘ palaces': Joscplliis (Ant. vii. 8. 5)
uses it of -Joab‘s field, called μερίς 2 Sam. xiv. 30.

ὁ ἀφυστερημένος ἀφ’ ὑμῶν] ‘Which 15 kept back by yon‚⁷ ‘comcs too
late from y0n.' The verb 15 only found here in N.T. In classical
writers ὑστερέω and its coinpounds are intransitive, as also in Sir. xiv.
14 μὴ ἀφυστερήσης ἀπὸ ἀγαθῆς ἡμέρας ‘ be not late for a feast‚’ Heb. xii.
15 ὑστερῶν ἀπὸ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Θεοῦ ‘falling short of,' Lnke xxii. 25 μή
τινος ὖστερήσατε; ‘ did ye come short in anythingl ’, Sir. xxvi. 19 ἀνὴρ
πολεμιστὴς ὑστερῶν δι’ ἔνδειαν. Of the transitive nse we have an example
in Neh. ix. 20 τὸ μάννα σου οὐκ ἀφυστέρησας ἀπὸ στόματος αὐτῶν. The
passive occurs Diod. xviii. 71 ὑστεροῦντο τῆς χρειάς, Enrip. Ipse. A. 1203
παιδὸς ὑστερήσομαι (1), 2 (jor. xi. 8 ‘ when I was in want (ὑστερηθείς) Ι was
not a bnrden on any 111an‚’ Heb. xi. 37 ὑστερούμενοι, θλιβόμενοι, Lnke xV.
14, 1 Cor. viii. 8, Phil. iV. 12, Sir. Xi. 11 ἔστι σπεύδων καὶ τόσῳ μᾶλλον ὗστε·
ρεῖται. 501110 take ἀπό = ὑπό comparing Luke xvii. 25 ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι ἀπὸ
τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης. 111 both cases I should prefer to explain it as denoting
not properly the agent, bnt the qual-ter from which the action proceeds.
Ι cannot agree with Hnther, Lange and Alford in connecting it with
κράζει ‘ cries from your cofferss The law required the prompt payment
of the workman, Dent. xxiv. 15 αὐθημερὸν ἀποδώσεις τὸν μισθὸν αὑτοῦ· οὐκ
ἐπιδιῖσεται ὁ ἥλιος ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, ὅτι πένης ἐστὶ καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ ἔχει τὴν ἐλπίδα
καὶ καταβοήσεται κατὰ σοῦ πρὸς Κύριον καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἁμαρτία, Levit.
xiX. 13,.101·. xxii. 13, Mal. iii. 5, Prov. iii. 27, 28, Sir. xxxi. (xxxiv.)
22 ἐκχέων αἷμα ὃ ἀποστερῶν μισθὸν μισθίου, Tobit iv. 14, Hermas

Vsae's. iii. 9 βλέπετε ὑμεῖς οἱ γαυρούμενοι ἐν τῷ πλούτῳ ὑμῶν μήποτε
στενάξουσιν οἱ ὑστερούμενοι καὶ ὃ στεναγμὸς αὐτῶν ἀναβήσεται πρὸς τὸν
Κύριον. Immediately afterwards he speaks of the ἰός received into

their hcart.

κράζει] The withholdiug of wages is 0110 of the fonr 51115 which art·
said to cry to heaven. Sec Dent. l.‹·.‚ (11011. 1ν. 10 thy brothcr's blood
βοᾷ πρός με ἐκ τῆς γῆς, Ν). xviii. 20 (cry of Sodoin), Job. xvi. 181011,
xxxi. 38, Sirac. xxxii. 17 προσευχὴ ταπεινοῦ νεφέλας διῆλθε...καὶ οὗ μὴ
