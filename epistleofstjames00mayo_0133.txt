THE OONTENTS OF THE EPISTLE cix

ξ under His hand and repent truly of their sins, He will lift them

ἱ up ; if they draw nigh to Him, He will draw nigh to them (iv, 7—10).

j Here, too, we may be helpful to one another by mutual confession,

z and by prayer for one another. Great is the power of prayer
prompted by the Spirit of God (V. 15—20).

It is characteristic of the QX& tone of the Epistle that it,
alone of the Epistles of the New Testament, contains no attempt
to conciliate the favour of the readers by direct words of praise.
In it we hear the bracing call of duty uttered by one who speaks
with earnest sympathy indeed and without a particle of Pharisaic
assumption, but who feels that he has the right to speak and

expects to be obeyed.
