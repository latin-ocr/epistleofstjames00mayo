Sto„ in apposition to the subject of οἰέσθω, like iii. 2 δυνατὸς χαλινα-
γωγῆσαι after τέλειος ἀνήρ, ver. 6 ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας after πῦρ, ver. 8
ἀκατάστατον κακόν after γλῶσσαν (though here the apposition is
irregular, see note), iv. 12 ὁ δυνάμενος after κριτής. Τ116 other way of
taking it seems to me to lack the energy of St. JameS, appealing less
directly to the person addressed and weakening the force and rhythm
of the following clause. The Vulg.‚ followed by Schneck„ Hofmann,
Schegg, δια, makes ver. 8 an entire sentence, vir duplam inconstans esc ,·
but, as Alford says, it is hardly possible that the writer could have
introduced a hitherto unknown, or at any rate a very unusual word
in this casua] way 3 Alford himself makes it a new predicate to ὁ
ἅνθρ. ἐκ. ‘ he is a man with two mindS,’ but the construction is certainly
easier if we take it in apposition to the subject : it will then sum up
in one pregnant word the substance of the two preceding verses.

ἀκατάστατος] Only here and below iii. 8 111 Ν.Τ. ; ‘unsettled‚' ‘un-
stable' (cf. οὐκ ἔχουσι ῥῖζαν Mark iv. 17); once in LXX. Isa. liv. 11

ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς.] ‘ In the whole course of his life': cf. below v.

compa-rison of life to a journey is implied in the words πορεύομαι, περκ
vra-reiis: see Vorst Ileboz p. 194 foll.

9. καυχάσθω.] Repeats the note of πᾶσαν χαράν ver. 2 : it stands first
in order to emphasize the opposition to διψυχία. Far from being thus
undet-ided and unsettled, the Christian should exult in his profession.
lf in low estate, he should glory in the church, where all are brothers
and there is no respect of persons 3 he should realize his own dignity as
a member of Christ, a child of God, an heir of heaven: if rich, he
should cease to pride himself on wealth or rank, and lejoice that he
has learnt the emptiness of all worldly distinctions and been taught th u,
