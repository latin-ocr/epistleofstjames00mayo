AUTHENTIOITY OF THE EPISTLE xlix

κ reader.l On the other hand, the old Syriae version (Peshitto)'-'

³ contains all the books of our present Canon excepting the Apoca—

lypse, the second of Peter, and the second and third of John.
Origen (H om. in va. vii. 1) recognizes all our books, and the cata-
logue contained in the Catechism of Cyril of Jerusalem (348 A.D.)
includes all but the Apocalypse‚ with an urgent warning against
the use of any other books. With him agrees Gregory of N azian-
zus writing about the same time, who ends his metrical catalogue
with the words πάσας ἔχεις. Εἴ τις δὲ τούτων ἐκτός, οὐκ ἐν
γνησίοις. Athanasius, in his 39th F estal Letter, dated 367 A.D.,
givos precisely our present Canon, concluding with the words ἐν
τούτοις μόνοις τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας διδασκαλεῖον εὐαγγελίζεται. μηδ-
εὶς τούτοις ἐπιβαλλέτω, μηδὲ τούτων ἀφαιρείσθω τι. Amphilo-
chius, bishop of Iconium, speaks less confidently in a metrical
catalogue (about 380 A.D.)‚ τινὲς δὲ φασὶ τὴν πρὸς Ἑβραίους νόθον,
οὐκ εὖ λέγοντες· γνησία γὰρ ἡ χάρις. εἷεν· τί λοιπόν ; καθολικῶν
ἐπιστολῶν τινὲς μὲν ἑπτὰ φασίν, οἱ δὲ τρεῖς μόνας χρῆναι δέχεσθαι,
τὴν Ἰακώβου μίαν, μίαν δὲ Πέτρου, τήν τ’ Ἰωάννου μίαν, τινὲς δὲ
τὰς τρεῖς καὶ πρὸς αὐταῖς τὰς δύο Πέτρου δέχονται τὴν Ἰουδᾶ δ’
ἑβδόμην· τὴν δ’ Ἀποκάλυψιν τὴν Ἰωάννου πάλιν τινὲς μὲν
ἐγκρίνουσιν, οἱ πλείους δέ γε νόθον λέγουσιν. Epiphanius, bishop
of Salamis in Cyprus, who died about 403 A.D., gives ‘ a canon of
the N.T. exactly coinciding with our own ' (ccclv. Haeres. lxxvi. 5).
On the other hand we aro told that our Epistle was rejected by
Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. mm?

Towards the end of the fourth century Jcronie (representing
the views of the Church of Rome) and Augustine (representing
the Church of Carthage) pronounced, in favour of our present
Canon. The judgrnent of the former is given in the Vulgate
and in the catalogue contained in his epistle Ad Pcczclimwn„ liii. 8 ;
elsewhere speaking of James he says (Vir. Ill. 2) ,Iac-obus qui
appellatur frater Domini. . . ‘zenam tcmtum scripsit epistulam, quac dc
septem Catholicis cst, quac ct ipsa αἶ) alio quodam sul) nominc ‹gjszcs

¹ O. H. Turner ffltml. Bihl. iii. 308) suggests that the original list contained only
1 John and 1 Peter, and that this was corrected by a later scribe, who appended the
note una sola implying that the MS. named only one Epistle in each case.

2 This has usually been ascribed to the beginning of the second century, but from
the absence of references to the Catholic Epistles in the Doctrz'nc of Addat· and the
Homines of Aphraates it has been argued that these Epistles were not included in
the earliest Syl-ian Canon. See Stud. Bm. iii. 1). 245, Class. Rev. iii. 456 soll.
