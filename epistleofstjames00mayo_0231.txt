CHAPTER X

D1D ST. JAMES WRITE IN GREEK oR IN ARAMAIC?

IN the First Series of Studia Bz'hlz‘ca, p. 1441'011„ Bishop John
W'ordsworth adduces the following arguments to show that our
Epistle was probably written in Aramaic:1—(1) This was the
language usually spoken by our Lord. (2) It was used by St.
Paul in his address to the mob of Jerusalem. (3) We are told by
Papias that the Gospel of St. Matthew was originally written in
Hebrew (ie. Aramaic) and interpreted by each as he was able.2
(4) Papias also states that St. Mark acted as interpreter to St.
Peter, and Glaucias, claimed by the Gnostics as the teacher of
Basilides, is named as another interpreter of the same Apostle.3
Jerome takes it for granted that the Epistles of St. Peter were
notssoriginally written in Greek, and thinks that the difference
between them was due to the employrnent of different men as
interp1·eters.4 (5) Some of the Fathers supposed the Epistle to
the Hebrews to have been written in Hebrew.6 <Iosephus wrote
his book on the VVars of the Jews in ‘ his national language ' and

1 According to Wold. Schmidt (Lchrfjelzcclt d. hrkobus-Brrbfm, p. 10) the Aramaic
origin of the Epistle had been previously maintained by Faber (obs. in epist. ‚lambi
ew Sym, Cohurg, 1770), Schmidt (Hq'storz·sch-Krz‘cz'sche Emlez'tuny in N. .'l'., Giessmi,
1818), Bertholdt (Einleitmzy, Erlangm, 1819).

stilo inter se ct charactere discrepant structuraque verborum. Eat qim intelliqimus pro
necessitate rerum diversis eum usum interpretibus. Bp. W. suggests that, if Glaucias
was the translator of the Second Epistle‚ this might account ior the doubt as to its
canonicity.
