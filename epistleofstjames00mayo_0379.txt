III 13-15 NOTES 119

The verb is used in its original sense of spinning Tobit ii. 11 (mid.)
ἡ γυνή μου ἠριθεύετο ἐν τοῖς γυναικείοις καὶ ἀπέστελλε τοῖς κυριοις, Heliod.
i. 5 (act.) αἱ γυναῖκες ἐριθεύουσιν.

μὴ κατακαυχᾶσθε] This verb was used above (ii. 13) with gen. to
denote the triumph of one principle over another, and so in the only
other passage where it occurs in N.T., Rom. xi. 17 μὴ κατακαυχῶ τῶν
κλάδων. Three other instances 01 its use are cited, all from the LXX„
Zech. X. 12 κατισχύσω αὐτοὺς ἐν Κυρίῳ καὶ ἐν ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ κατακαυχήσον-
ται, and Jer. l. (xxvii.) 11 and 38, where the verb is used absolutely,
κατά having only an intensifying force, as in κατακτείνω, κατάδηλος.
The question whether it should be thus taken here will be considered
111 connexion with the following clause.

ψεύδεσθε κατὰ τῆς ἀληθείας] 11 you have bitterness you cannot be truly
wise, for wisdom is shown by gentleness, your profession therefore is
alie: cf. 1 John i. 6 ἐὰν εἴπωμεν ὅτι κοινωνίαν ἔχομεν μετ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν
σκότει περιπατῶμεν, ψευδόμεθα καὶ οὗ ποιοῦμεν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, ib. iv. 20,
Wisd. Vi. 25 φθόνος οὗ κοινωνήσει σοφίᾳ. Some (VVieSinger, Hofmann)
take τῆς ἀληθείας to mean the Gospel, as above i. 18, explaining it of
false teachers‚ blind leaders of the blind, who, like those referred to in
1 Cor. i. 18-23, speak contemptuously 01 the G0>pel and misrepresent
its doctrines. Perhaps it is simpler to understand it of ‘ the facts 01
the case,' for which Bloomfield compares Diod. i. 2 ἔνια κατεψεῦσθαι τῆς
ἀληθείας, J os. BJ. prooem. 1 (former historians) καταψέυδονται τῶν
πραγμάτων; (‘you claim to be enlightened Christians, but enlighten-
ment joined with bitterness and sels-seeking comes not from God, but
from the devil.⁷) The expression is no doubt pleonastic : it would
have been enough to say ‘ your boast 01 wisdom is at variance with the
truth,' but emphasis is added by the fuller phrase, as in the passage
quoted from St. John. If we understand it thus it would seem that
κατακαυχᾶσθε must be taken absolutely (ί (10 not boast of wisdom and
so lie against the truth ') and not with κατὰ τῆς ἀληθείας 111 the sense of
‘ triumphing over the truth.' See however Zahn N. K. p. 792 oz.

above i. 5, Philo M. 1. p. 571 σοφία ἄνωθεν ὀμβρηθεῖσα ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ, ib. p.
524, and on the opposition of θεία καὶ οὐράνιος σοφία to ἐπίγειος σοφία ib.
p. 511. and 1 Cor. 1. 19 1011. esp. ii. 6 σοφίαν λαλοῦμεν ἐν τοῖς τελείοις,
σοφίαν δὲ οὐ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου (= ἐπίγειον)...ἀλλὰ λαλοῦμεν σοφίαν Θεοῦ

passage, also John viii. 23 εἷ τὰ ἐπίγεια εἶπον ὑμῖν καὶ οὐ πιστεύετε, πῶς,
