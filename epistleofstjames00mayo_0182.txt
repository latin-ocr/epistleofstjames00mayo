'clviii THE EPIsTLE or sT. JAMES

δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος· καὶ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως μόνον ³ from actions, not
from believing.' In v. 15 ἡ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα,
the article is used with εὐχή because of the preceding προσευξ-
άσθωσαυ, and πίστεως has the article by sympathy, unless we
prefer to translate ‘Faith's prayer,' giving its full personifying
force to the article. It is not necessary however, either in
classical or Hellenistic Greek, for the abstract noun always to take
the article even in the nominative: thus we have ii. 13 κατα-
καυχᾶται ἔλεος κρίσεως, where we might have expected τὸ ἔλεος
τῆς κρίσεως κατακαυχᾶται, but the absence of the article gives a
further point to the antithesis, first by bringing together the con-
trasted words, and second by calling attention to the connotation
of the words. So iii. 10 ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ στόματος ἐξέρχεται
εὐλογία καὶ κατάρα ‘out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing
and cursing‚’ which might of course also be translated ‘a blessing
and a curse.’ Such omission of the article is especially common
in proverbs or other familiar and sententious phrases,

We will now consider the case in which the Greek anarthrous
noun is represented in English by the noun with definite article.
A well-known instance is that of βασιλεύς standing for the king
of Persia. Here the intermediate stage would be ὁ βασιλεύς
‘the king par eoecellenoe‚’- as Englishmen were accustomed to
speak ef ‘ the Duke’ meaning ‘the Duke of Wellington'3 then
after a time βασιλεύς by itself gets to be regarded as a
proper name. In our Epistle‚ we find the article regularly
used with Κύριος and Θεός in the nominative (6.9. i. 13, ii. 5,
19, iv. 6, 15, v. 11, 15); but the oblique cases sometimes take
the article (6.9. iv, 4 ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ...ἐχθρός τοῦ Θεοῦ, ii. 1
τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου, V. 7, 8 ἡ παρουσία τοῦ Κυρίου bis,
iv. 7 ὑποτάγητε τῷ Θεῷ, iv. 8 ἐγγίσατε τῷ Θεῷ, ii. 23 ἐπίστευ-
σεν τῷ Θεῷ, iii. 9 εὐλογοῦμεν τὸν Κύριον, i. 27 παρὰ τῷ
Θεῷ, i. 7 παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου) and sometimes omit it (6.9. i. 1
Θεοῦ καὶ Κυρίου δοῦλος, i. 20 ὀργὴ ἀνδρὸς δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ οὐκ
ἐργάζεται, iii. 9 καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν Θεοῦ, ii. 23 φίλος Θεοῦ, ν. 4 τὰ
ὦτα Κυρίου, v. 10 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, ν. 11 τὸ τέλος Κυρίου,
i. 13 ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πειράζομαι, iv, 10 ἐνώπιον Κυρίου). The practice
of St. J ames in this respect is that of the other writers of the N.T.
The nominative Θεός, when it stands as the subject of the sentence,
is rarely found without the article: St. Paul uses the anarthrous
