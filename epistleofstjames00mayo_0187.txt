ΟΝ THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMEs clxiii

τωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. This is very
common in the LXX„ and especially in the Apocrypha, Cf]-
ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἡμῶν Barnch iii. 7, cf. Sir. ii. 17, v. 2, xiii. 19, Psahn.
Sal. vi. 7, μὴ μνησθῇς ἀδικιῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ, μνήσθητι
χειρός σου Baruch iii. 5, δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν οὐδὲ
ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδοῖς ἐντολῶν Θεοῦ il). iv. 13, ἐπὶ τραχήλους αὐτῶν
ἐπιβήσῃ, V. 25, 1 Mace. ii. 10 ποῖον ἔθνος οὐκ ἐκληρονόμησε βασι·
λείαν αὑτῆς,· (‘ her kingdom ⁵), v. 44 ἐν ὀρΎῇ αὐτῶν ‘in their
wrath‚' v. 70 ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τάφοις πατέρων αὐτῶν ‘in the
sepulchre of their fathers,' Sir. i. 11 ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τελευτῆς αὐτοῦ
εὐλογηθήσεται ‘in the day of his end,' iii. 5 ἐν ἡμέρα προσευχῆς
αὐτοῦ, iii. 10 ἐν ἀτιμία πατρός σου, Psalm. Sal. iv. 18 ἀπὸ κροτά-
φων αὐτοῦ ‘from his temples‚' viii. 5 παρελύθη γόνατά μου coming
between συνετρίβη ἡ ὀσφύς μου and ἐφοβήθη ἡ καρδία μου. In
like manner the article is omitted with the possessive prmnoun,
6.{J.P1·OV. iii. 5 ἐπὶ σῇ σοφία μὴ ε’παίρου, V. 21 τήρησον ἐμὴν βουλήν.

Sometimes both article and genitive are omitted, as in iv. 8
καθαρίσατε χεῖρας ἁμαρτωλοὶ καὶ ἁγνίσατε καρδίας δίψυχοι
‘cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purify your hearts ye double-
minded.’ Probably this is to be explained as a proverbial phrase
approaching to a componml, like our ‘shake hands‚’ ‘up-stai1·s.’
We may compare Sir. xxxviii. 10 εὔθυνον χεῖρας καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης
ἁμαρτίας καθάρισον καρδίαν, 1 Mace. Xii. 39 ἐζήτησε Τρύφων
ἐκτεῖναι χεῖρα ἐπὶ Ἀντίοχον.

I will now take in order, with one or two exceptions which
will be noted later, the remaining instances in which an
anarthrous Greek noun takes the definite article in the RV.
These are i. 10 ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου παρελεύσεται ‘as the flower
of the grass he shall pass away.' Ι see no objection here to a
more literal rendering ‘as a flower of grass‚' tle. ‘as a'wild
flower '3 111 v. 11 we have the article τὸν χόρτον, τὸ ἄνθος because
they have been already referred to: i. 20 ὀργὴ ἀνδρὸς δικαιο-
σύνην Θεοῦ οὐκ ἐργάζεται ‘the wrath of man worketh not the
righteousness of God ' might perhaps be rendered ‘ a man’s wrath
worketh not God's righteousness‚' but Ι am disposed to think that
the absence of the article (which is facilitated here by the law of
correlation, δικαιοσύνην dropping its article in order to conform
with the naturally anarthrous Θεοῦ, and the phrase ὀρνγὴ ἀνδρός
being in like manner made conformable to the phrase δ. Θ.) is
