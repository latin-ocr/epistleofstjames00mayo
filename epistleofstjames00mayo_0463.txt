given form of words is both necessary to, and sufficient for salv-atim),
and that heterodoxy is the worst of sins.

We are not to suppose however that St. J ames would in these words
discourage the wish to arrive at a clear intellectual view in religion.
The ‘ word which is able to save the 30111> 13 113611 addressed in the
first instance to the understanding, though it must penetrate the whole
nature before its work can be accomplished. It no less belongs to
man, as a rational being, to think clearly, than it belongs to him, as a
moral being, to act riqhtly. ‘I will pray with the spirit ' says St. Paul,
‘ but I will pray with the understanding also' : and st. Peter, or whoever
is the author of the second Epistle which goes under his name, warns
us of the danger arising from the misunderstanding of the written
word, where he speaks of the hard things contained in St. Paurs
epistles, ‘ which they that are unlearned and ignorant wrest, as they do
also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.' To grasp fully
the meaning of each separate statement, as intended by the writer and
understood by the original readers, will often tax our powers to
the utmost 3 and we have besides to consider how far each separate
statement is to be qualified or limited or balanced by other statements‚
whether in 13116 same book or in the other Scriptures 3 and again how
far changed circumstances, changed modes of thought and expression,
necessitate a change in the form of the doctrine taught 3—before we can
be sure of what is the actual teaching of the Spirit to the Church in
our own day. It is from neglecting these things, from the misunder-
standing 01 forms of speech, or from fixing the mind exclusively on
one side of Christian teaching, that erroneous views as to the Sacra-
ments and as to Predestination have become so widely prevalent. It
was therefore only natural and right that the Catholic Church should
seek to guard against the misinterpretation of revealed truth, first, by
drawing up short summaries of the essentials 01 belief for the use of all
her members, and secondly by careful exposition 01 1116 teaching of the
Bible 'on particular doctrines, made by the most learned 01 1161· sons. St.
J ames is not of course to be regarded as objecting to such formularies
or treatises. It is not the creed he finds fault with, but the belief
that a man 13 saved by the coriectness of his creed.

Every extreme in religion is sure to give rise to the opposite
ext1e.me If therefore one party exagger ate the impor tance 01 a correct
statement 01 Christian truth, and make this correctness consist in a
repetition of phrases devised by the Fathers 01 1116 fourth or of some
later century, rather than in the actual teaching of Christ and his
Apostles, if they restrict the freedom 01 thought by unwarrantable
assertions that the Church has already arrived at absolute truth‚ and
that the duty of reason is not to question, but simply to bow down in
adoration of a mystery 3 it was to be expected that another party
would spring up, who would not only deny that the Church had any
right to put out an authoritative statement of doctrine, but would also
deny the possibility 01 arriving at any conclusion whatever 111 matters
of theology, and even that there was any connexion between doctrine
and conduct. Such persons might be disposed to claim the authority
