Ο.Τ. rather than of the N.T. This agrees with what we read of ε11111100,
the president of the Church at Jerusalem. Remarlzable agreements
between this Epistle and the speeches and letter of St. dames contained
in the Acts, This J ames was known as the Lord's brother, p. V. Three
different explanations of the phrase. Passages of scripture bearing on
the subject. Hieronymian theory examined, p. ix. Epiphanian theory,
p. xviii. Helvidian theory, p. xxii. Examination of the objection, that
the last is opposed to tradition, p. xxiii3 and to Christian sentiment, p.
xxxiii. Further particulars as to St. Jaines derived from uninspired
writings, p. xxxvi„ the Gospel according to the Hebrews, Hegesippus,
Josephus, Clementine Homilies. General conclusion as to the life and
character of St. J aines, p. xli. Hellenism in Syria. Resemblances between

CHAPTER 11

EXTERNAL EVIDENCE FOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE EPISTLE

lDirect evidence: Eusebius in his account of the Canonical books classes it
¹ amongst the Antileqomena, but elsewhere cites it as genuine, p. xlvii. It
is omitted 111 the Muratorian fragment and in the Canon Mommsenianus 3
but included in the Peshitto and in the Catalogues of Origen, Cyril os
Jerusalem, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius, Amphilochius of Iconium,
Epiphanius, Jerome and Augustine, and was finally accepted by the third
Council of Carthage, p. xlviii. Indirect evidence .- was known to Clement
of Rome, to the author of the Didache, of the Epistle os Barnabas, and
of the Testaments of the Patriarchs, to Ignatius and to Polycarp, p. 1.
Hermas is full of allusions to it, p. lvii. It is referred to by Justin
Martyr, Athenagoras, Irenaeus, Theophilus, Clement of Alexandria, and
by the writers of the Ep. ad Diognetum, and the Acta Johannis, p. lxi.
Origen first cites it by name as Scripture and as the work of St. J ames,
p. lxiii. Allusions are also found to it in Tertullian, Dionysius of
Alexandria, Gregory Thaumaturgus, the Clementine Homilies, Consti-
tutiones Apostolicae, Lactantius, Athanasius, Chrysostoin and Didymus.
By the end of the fourth century it is all but universally accepted, p. lx1ii.
