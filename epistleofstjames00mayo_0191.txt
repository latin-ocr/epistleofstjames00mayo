ΟΝ THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMES clxvii

noun, which properly denotes only a single subject, it is equiva-
lent to ‘ all,' as in 1. 21 πᾶσαν ῥυπαρίαν ‘all filthiness,' i. 2 πᾶσαν
χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε ‘think it entire jOy'3 so perhaps πᾶσα δόσις
ἀγαθή ί311 good giving’ in i. 17; in the phrase πᾶσα καύχησις
τοιαύτη iv. 16 it may be better to translate ‘every such boasting‚'
because the addition of τοιαύτη splits up the idea of καύχησις,
while the absence of the article forbids us to make a new unit,
such as would be implied by ἡ τοιαύτη καύχησις. We find the
article in i. 8 ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ ‘in all his ways,' and
with ὅλος 111 11.1Ο ὅλον τὸν νόμον, 111. 2 ὅλον τὸ σῶμα. More
rarely we find ὅλος placed after the article and substantive, as in
τὸν κόσμον ὅλον Mark viii. 36. In both these cases ὅλος 15
properly in apposition‚ and is thus more forcible than when it
is placed between the article and substantive, as it sometimes is 111
classical writings, but never in the N.T. Πᾶς however occurs in
this order in Acts XX. 18 τὸν πάντα χρόνον, Gal. V. 14 ὁ πᾶς
νόμος, διο.

An adjective or participle may stand by itself as a substantive,
if its omitted subject 15 made sufficiently clear by gender, number,
and context, eg. Θεὸς ὑπερηφάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται iv. 6, εἰδότι καλὸν
ποιεῖν...ἁμαρτία ἐστίν iv. 173 and such a substantive may be
defined by the article like a proper substantive, eg. i. 6 ὁ διακρινό-
μενος, 1. 11 ὀ πλούσιος, 11. 16 τὰ ἐπιτήδεια, iii. 11 τὸ Ὑλυκύ, τὸ
πικρόν. In like manner the infinitive, which is used by itself as a
substantive in apposition in i. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ αὕτη ἐστίν,
ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανούς, may be defined by the article and thus
become capable of inflexion, as in τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι, V. 17. The same
holds good of adverbs or any other indeclinable word or phrase, as
in v. 12 ἤτω ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναί, where the article serves to dis-
tinguish the first ναί, which is subject, from the second ναί, which
is predicate. It has been stated above that a substantive may bc
qualified by an adverb interposed between it and the article, as
ἡ ἄνωθεν σοφία 111 iii. 17. If the noun is such as can be easily
supplied in thought, from its being part of a common phrase or
any other reason, it is often omitted, as in ἡ αὔριον (ἡμέρα) 1ν. 14.
Again the neuter article is often used with the genitive to express
the general conception of the person or thing denoted, and thus
we get the phrase τὸ τῆς αὔριον 111 the verse referred to,
