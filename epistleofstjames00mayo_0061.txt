THE AUTHOR xxxvii

Just, and said to him, My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of
Man has risen from the dead? 1

It will be seen from the note that there are other versions of the
story, and that in these the vow is said to have been made after the
death of Christ. It is easy to see how a confusion might have
arisen if James, whether having heard from others or himself
having witnessed the events of the Last Supper, had shaped his
vow after the Lord’s own words ‘ Ι will not drink henceforth of the
fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come? There is, I
think, a ring of genuineness about the narrative. Whereas we
usually find in the Apocryphal Gospels some real incident of our
Lord's life smothered in a parasitic growth of puerilities and

¹ The Latin is Dominus autem cnm dedisset sindonem servo sacerdotis (apparently
implying that Malchus was present at the resurrection and received from the Lord's
hands the linen eloth in which his body had been wrapt), r{vit ad Jacobum et ap-
paruit ei—Juraz-erat enim Jacobzts se non comesuram ,vanem ab illa hora qua biberat
calicem Domini, donce videret enm resurgentem a dormientibus ‚·—rursusquc post pantu-
lntn ⁴ afferte, ait Dominus, mensam ct panem) Statimque additur .· Tulit panem et bene-
dirz't ae fregit et dedit Jacobo Justo et chima ei, ‘ Frater mi, comede panem tuum, quia
resurrexit Filias hominis a dormitantibus! Bp. Lightfoot reads calicem Domi-
nus for calicem Domini, ‘ as the point of time which we should naturally expect is not
the institution of the eucharist, but the Lord's death,’ to which He had Hiniself alluded
under the phrase of ‘drinking the cup' (Matt. xx. 22, 23, xxvi. 39, 42; cf. Mart.
Polye. 14 ἐν τῷ ποτηρίῳ τοῦ Χριστοῦ σου), and the Greek translation, which goes
under the name of Sophronius, has Κύριος. There is however no various reading in
Herding's edition of the De Vir. Itl'ztstr„ and Mr. Nicholson, in his edition of the
fragments of the Gospel according to the Hebrews (pp. 62 solt), gives instances of
the untrustworthiuess of the Greek translator. If Domini is the true reading, ‘ the
writer represented Janies as present at the Last Supper‚ but it does not follow that he
regarded him as one of the Twelve. He may have assigned to him...a position apart
from, and in some respects superior to, the Twelve... It is characteristic of a J udaie
writer that an appearance which seems in reality to have been vouchsafed to J ames
to win him over from his unbelief, should be represented as a reward for his devotion ’
(Lightfoot, l. e.). The story appears in three other forms, given in Nicholson, none
os which date the oath from the Last Suppcr. Thus Gregory of T ours, in the sixth
century, (Hist. Frane. i. 21) writes: Fertur Jacobits Apostolus, eunt Dominum jam
mortuam vidisset in errice, detestatum esse atque jurasse numquam sc comesturam
panem. nisi Dominam cerneret resnrqentcm. Tertia die rediens Domimts...Jacob0 se
ostendens ait ‘ surgye Jaeobe, comede, quiajam a mortuis reszcrreaei' ; his contemporary,
the pseudo-Abdias (H ist. Apost. vi. 1), who refers to Hegesippus as his authority for
part of his account of James, says that he was son of Joseph by a former wife, and
so full of love to Jesus nt crucifixo eo eibum capere noluerit, priusquam a mortuis
resumentem videret, qaod meminerat sibi et fratribus a Christo aqente in vivzsssfaisse
praedictam. Quare ei primum omnium, ut et Mariae Magdalenae et Petro apparere
voluit...et ne diutinum jejumum toleraret, favo ‘mellis oblato ad comedendum insuper
Jacobuvm invitavit. Similarly in the thirteenth century J ac. de V01agine (Leyend. Aur.
lxvii.): In Parasceue aretem mortuo Domino, sient dicit Joscphus et Hieronynzuzzs in
libro De Viris lunaribus, Jacobus votnm vovit, διο, rnixing up in what follows the
accounts of Jerorne and Gregory. Mr. Nicholson thinks that J oscphus herc stands
for Hegesippus, the names being often interchanged, and that the latter may he
the original authority for the particulars in which thc later writers diti'er from
J erome.
