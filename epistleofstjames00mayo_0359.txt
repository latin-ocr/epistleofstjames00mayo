St. J ames and the writer of the epistle 10 1116 Hebrews direct attention
by his phrase διὰ πίστιν καὶ φιλοξενίαν ἐσώθη Ῥαάβ, 066 Lightfoot on 11110
passage and also his appendix (pp. 413 and 470) 011 the attempt made
both by Jewish and Christian writers <Josephus, Ohrysostom‚ abc.) to
weaken the force of the word πόρνη.

26. τὸ σῶμα. χωρὶς ’πνεύματος νεκρόν {cra-tw] ,1 t seems 111, first strange that,
the outward visible part of man should be compared 10 1116 invisible prin—
ciple of saith, and the invisible spirit be compared to works which are
the outward fruits of faith 3 but we must always keep in mind that st.
dames is speaking here not of saith of the heart, but of a mere useless ⁵
profession of orthodoxy, ‘ professing to know God but in deeds denying
Him’ (2 Tim. iii. 5), ⁴ having the form of godliness without the power’
(Tit. i. 16).1 And as ‘saith ' thus becomes a mere extemality, 00 ‘ works '
become identified with the working principle of love. It thus becomes
easy to understand how a mere 011611 of profession void of the animating
principle of love can be 60111961 ed to 11 601 pse. Or we might under stand
πνεῦμα of‘ 11161111 as in Ps. cxlvi. 4, Apoc. xi. 11, xiii 15 (so Peile and
Bassett), which would give a simpler illustr· ation: as ι bodv which does
not bi eathe' 10 dead, so faith which does not act.2 A similar metaphor 10
found ln Curtius x. 6 (19) mi‘litams sine duce ‹im-ba corpus sine spiritu, est.

III.-1. The writer goes¹ back to the subject of i. 19 βραδὺς εἷς τὸ
λαλῆσαι, and i. 26 μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν, which suggests the figure of
vv. 2 and 3. It is also connected with that overvaluation of theory as
compared with practice which formed the subject of the last chapter.
