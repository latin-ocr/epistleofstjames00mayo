commandment of G0d‚ say, the duty of honouring our parents, it will
not atone for 131113, though we should be most scrupulous in all other
respects 3 the one wilful neglect proves 1311313 we were nob acbuated by
a right, mobive in our obedience to 13110 0131101· commandments : 113 shows
that we were nob led by the spirit of God.

In the 3rd chapter we read ⁶ 111 many things we all offend ' 13110 word
(πταίομεν) being 'ohe same as 1311313 used here, where it is said, 1311313 ‘ he
who offends in one point, is guilty of alls How 1311011 are any 130 be
saved2 This is explained in V. 13 ‘mercy triumpheth ove1·judg1nent,'
which follows closely on 13110 words ‘ So speak and so 3013, as being
about] to be tried by the law of liberty) The law of liberty is 313 once
more exacting and more merciful 1311311 13110 law of bondage. Ι13 13 13110

latter, because, where there is real love of good, and real desire and
effort, 130 do right, God accepts 13110 will for 13110 deed. To bear in mind
therefore 1311313 we shall be judged by 13110 law of liberty tends 130
produce in us a deeper conviction of sin, 313 the same ‘nime 1311313 113 frees
us from anxiety, because we believe ‘chat God Hiniself desires that we
may be perfect as He is perfect, and 1311313 Ηο will accomplish 131113
perfectiori in us by 13110 presence of His Holy Spirit in our hear‘os, if
we are willing 130 receive 113.

without werke, profession without practice, is worthless‚ as worthless
as a mere vertat philanthropy. Even is sneh a saith were real, it

shown by the ficet that even the devils possess sach saith. The
typicat eoeaonples os saith yiven in the Old Testament prove that the
saith which justifies must be an active principle. The sanction os
saith is to inspire aetion, cond it is itsels perseeted by aetion. An

inaetive saith is the mere eorpse os reliyion. [See especially 1101303
