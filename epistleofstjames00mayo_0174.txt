cl THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

the author of that doctrine, which must therefore have been
unknown before him and denied by all but his immediate
school; and again, that if we meet with any teaching which seems
inconsistent with such a doctrine, it must have proceeded
from a controversialist of the opposite school: so that we are
guilty, for instance, of an anachronism in assigning to Christ the
words, ‘Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the
prophets,' ‘One jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law’

(Pfleiderer, page 492 foll), since they involve the principles of
Paulinism and anti-Paulinism. But why cannot we act here as
we do in the parallel case of the disciples of Socrates? We do not
dispute the genuineness of a Gynic or Oyrenaic or Academic
phrase attributed to Socrates, because he did not carry out these
different lines of thought to the full extent to which each was
carried by his disciples. Yet it is assumed a priori that James,
Peter, and John being typical of particular aspects of Christianity‚
anything in their writings which appears to be inconsistent with
that special aspect must be pronounced spurious3 that even a man
so many-sided and so full of growth as St. Paul must be tied down
to the ideas which occupied him during a certain critical period of
the Church's development. If we were to impose the same rule
on ΜΓ. Gladstone, how little we should leave him of all the books
and speeches which now bear witness to his incessant activity and
versatility of mind.

But perhaps the most mischievous manifestation of the cc priori
method is when it seizes on some small side-incident, and makes ¹
it the corner-stone of a huge theory, by which all the phenomena 1
are to be explained, or, in the event of a too stubborn resistancc, 3
to be exploded. Such an incident is the difference between St. i
Peter and St. Paul, of which passing mention is made in Galatians l
ii. 11, 12, and in which Baur finds the key to the whole of the
early history of the Ohureh as well as to the Christian literature
of the first two centuries. It might really seem as if to some of
his followers the main article of the Creed was ‘I believe in the
quarrel between Peter and Paul, and in the well-meaning but un-
successful attempts of Luke and others to smooth it over and keep
it in the background.'

It may encourage those who are fearful as to the results of the
present attack on the integrity of the books of the N ew Testament,
