understands of Christ3 but as the immediately preceding references
in Clement are to the O.T. it is more natural to supply Θεός or
ἡ γραφή. It is however ascribed to Christ in Didascalia ii. 3 λέγει
Κύριος ἀγάπη καλύπτει κ.τ.λ. The original is found in Prov. x. 12 (Heb.
not LXX.) ‘hate stirreth up strife, but love covereth all transgres-
sionS,' cf. Psa. lxxxv. 2 ἀφῆκας τὰς ἀνομίας τῷ λαῷ σου, ἐκάλυψας πάσας
τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν, ib. xxxi. l, 2, Nehem. iv. 5 μὴ καλύψῃς ἐπὶ ἀνομίαν,
Ep. ad Diogn. c. 9 τί γὰρ ἄλλο τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν ἠδυνήθη καλύψαι ἢ
ἐκείνου (Χριστοῦ) δικαιοσύνη ,⁴1 There can be no doubt about the meaning
of the verse in Proverbs, ‘ love refuses to see faults': are we to attach the
same meaning to it in St. Peter, where it follows a warning to ‘ be sober
and watch unto prayer '2 ‘ Above all things being fervent in your love
amongst yourselveS‚ for (ὅτι) love covereth a multitude of sins) Love
is recommended because it covers (hides) sin. This seems to imply
more than the mere shutting the eye of man to sin: it implies that
sin, including the sin of him who loves, at least as much as that
of him who is loved‚2 is thus cancelled, blotted out even in the
sight of God, cf. Luke Vii. 47 ἀφέωνται αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῆς αἱ πολλαί,
ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ, and above ii. 13 κατακαυχᾶται ἕλεος κρίσεως. In
other Hebrew writings we find love narrowed to ἐλεημοσύνη (‘pity'
rather than ‘almsgiving')‚ yet with the same promise attached to
it, Sir. iii. 28 ἐλεημοσύνη ἐξιλάσεται ἁμαρτίας, Dan. iv. 24 τὰς ἁμαρτίας
σου ἐν ἐλεημοσύναις λύτρωσαι καὶ τὰς ἀδικίας ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς πενήτων, Tobit
iv. lO ἐλεημοσύνη’ εκ Oavdrov‘ ρύεται καὶ οὐκ ἐᾷ. εἰσελθεῖν εις τὸ σκότος, δῶρον
γὰρ ἀγαθόν ἐστιν ἐλεημοσύνη, ib. xii. 9 ἐλεημοσύνη ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται καὶ
αὐτὴ ἀποκαθαίρει πᾶσαν ἁμαρτίαν, οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐλεημοσύνην χορτασθήσονται
ζωῆς. Or love 1s narrowed to the keeping of the fifth commandment‚
as in Sir. lii. 3 ο τιμῶν πατέρα ἐξιλασεται ἁμαρτίας, ib. V. 14 ἐλεημοσύνη
πατρὸς οὒκ ἐπιλησθήσεται καὶ ἀντὶ ἁμαρτιῶν προσανοικοὸομηθήσεταί σοι ‘pity
for a father shall not be forgotten, it shall be imputed to thee for good
against thy sins.’ Similarly Clem. R. ii. 16 καλὸν ἐλεημοσύνη ὡς μετάνοια
ἁμαρτίας· κρείσσων νηστεία προσευχῆς, ἐλεημοσύνη δὲ ἀμφοτέρων, then he
quotes the verse from St. Peter, and continues ἐλεημοσύνη γὰρ κούφισμα
ἁμαρτίας γίνεται, which leaves no doubt as to the way in which he under-
stood it.3 Dr. Lightfoot in his note says ‘in J ames v. 20 the expression seems
still to be used of the sins of others, but in the sense of burying them
from the sight of God, wiping them out by the repentance of the sinner.‘
He cites Tertull. Scorp. 6 as understanding the words to mean ‘ atones
for a multitude of one's own sins, ’ and so Clem. Al. Quis div. sal. ξ 38,
p. 956 ἐὰν ταύτην (τὴν ἀγάπην) ἐμβάληταί τις τῇ ψυχῇ, δύναται, κᾶν ἐν ἁμαρ-
τήμασιν ῂ γεγεννημένος κᾶν πολλὰ τῶν κεκωλυμένων εἰργασμένος, αἰξήσας
τὴν ἀγάπην καὶ μετάνοιαν καθαραν λαβών, ἀναμαχέσασθαι τα ἐπταισμένα,
ib. Strom. i. p. 4233 in Strom. ii. p. 463 ἀγάπη is understood of God's
f01g1vlng love. There is a iemarkable passage of 01 igen (Hom. in [ευ.
