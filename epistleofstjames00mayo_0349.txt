of love' (Helo. vi. 10). But the asyndeton allows the words 10 be taken
in their widest generality, as embodying the very essence of the Christian
law of liberty, affirming the universal principle of God's judgment‚
even when it seems to be ἀνέλεος, and supplying the rule for the
believer's daily life, cf. Philo M. 1. p. 284 οὑ μόνον δικάσας ἐλεεῖ ἀλλὰ
ἐλεήσας δικάζει· πρεσβύτερος γὰρ δίκης ὃ ἕλεος παρ7 αὐτῷ ἐστίν, ἅτε τὸν
κολάσεως ἄξιον οὐ μετὰ τὴν δίκην ἀλλὰ πρὸ δίκης εἰδότι.

14—26. In this section St. J ames proceeds to enlm-ge on the meaning
and nature of that saith in Jesus Christ which was spoken of in ver. 1
as inconsistent with προσωπολημψία. He dwells on the contrast‚ noted
in i. 26, between mere outward religion and the consecration of the
life to God. If a man πίστιν ἔχει ἐν προσωπολημψίαις, iS not this the
same as having a profession of saith which is not evidenced by (1661162
But it is not such faith as this that can ever triumph over judgment.
Compare the words of St. John (1 ep. ii. 4) ὁ λέγων ὅτι Ἔγνωκα αὐτὸν,
καὶ τὰς ἐντολας μὴ τηρῶν, ψεύστης ἐστίν. Τ116 apocrypha] fourth book
of Esdras shows that the question of saith and works was at that time
agitated among the Jews, see ix. 7. S ‘ whoever shall be able 10 escape
either by his works or by his faith shall sce my salvation,' also viii.
33-36‚ xiii. 23. For the relation of St. James’ view of saith to that of
St. Paul and 1116 011161 apostles see Oomment.

14. τί ὅῴελος.] Τ116 omission of 1116 article ( what good is it,' ‘what
boots it,' instead of ‘ what is the good'), especially when the verb is
understood, is somewhat colloquial and has a sharp abruptness which
suits the passage. 11 16 omitted also by Philo M 1. p. 241 τί γὰρ ὄφελος
λέγειν μὲν τὰ βέλτιστα, διανοεῖσθαι δὲ καὶ πράττειν τὰ αἴσχιστα. . ,τί δὲ ὄφελος
ἂ μὲν χρὴ διανοεῖσθαι ἔργοις δὲ ἀτόποις καὶ λόγοις χρῆσθαι,· and p. 295,
320, M 2. p. 333, also by Plato and Xen. The only other place in
which the word occurs in N.T. is 1 Cor. XV. 32 εἷ κατ’ ἄνθρωπον ἐθηριο-
μάχησα, τί μοι τὸ ὅφελοςς

ἔργα] Τ116 ἕλεος of ver. 13. Cf. Clem. Hom. viii. ἰ’ οὐ γὰρ ὠφελήσει
τινὰ τὸ λέγειν ἀλλὰ τὸ ποιεῖν· ἐκ παντὸς οὖν τρόπου καλῶν ἔργων χρεία, Pirke
Aboth ‘say little, do much ' (Taylor J. ff. p. 38), Philo M. 1. p. 525 ἡ
ἄνευ πράξεως θεωρία ψιλὴ πρὸς οὐδὲν ὄφελος τοῖς ἐπιστήμοσιν.

μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν,·] Τ116 interrogative μή, expecting Of
course a negative answer, occurs again below iii. 12, and is very fre-
quent in the lst epistle 10 the Corinthians and the Gospel of St. ,J ohn.
For σῶσαι cf. i. 21 : it is the triumph of mercy over judgment of ver.
13. ἡ πίστις 1101 saith absolutely, but such faith as this, fides illa
quam vos habere dicitis (Bede).

15. ἐὰν ἀδελφός] See 11. 011 1. 2. Jf δέ 16 inserted after ἐάν we should
have to consider this a second parallel case, in which profession is
opposed to reality3 but it makes better sense to omit it with B. and
Sin. and take this as a concrete illustration of the abstract principle
stated in ver. 14. Compare 1 John iii. 17, 18 (where the empty pro-
fession of love is oontrasted with the living reality), Philo M 1. p. 527
ὥσπερ ἐν ἰατροῖς ἡ λεγομένη λογοϊατρεία πολὺ τῆς τῶν καμνόντων ὠφελείας
