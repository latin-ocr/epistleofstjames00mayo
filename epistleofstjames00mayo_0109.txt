World, the Truth‚ the Light, the Glory‚ the New Birth‚ the Liberty
of Christ. No doubt the writings of St.. John exhibit, as we
should expect, a far greater depth of thought and a more advanced
Christianity than are to be found in our Epistle3 but, along with
this, there is a general harmony and community of ideas, such as
might naturally result from reinembrances of a common teaching,
or from continued association on the part of the two writers. If
we come to the conclusion that in some cases this similarity is
more easily explained by direct borrowing, it seems to me that the
borrower is in all probability St. John. The richness and fulness
of expression in such passages as 1 John ii. 15,111. 9, 111. 17, 21,
might easily grow out of the brief hints given in the parallels
of St. J ames, but it is scarcely conceivable that the latter
should have deliberately discarded thoughts of such interest
and value, if he had had them in writing before him. The
same considerations will apply to the parallels to our Epistle
which are to be found in the writings of St. Peter and St. Paul.
It was easy for the latter, writing from a more advanced standing-
point, to bring out and to emphasize the more distinctively s
Christian doctrines which were still undeveloped and to some
extent latent in St. James. That St. James should deliberately
have gone backwards, when those doctrines had once received
definite expression, is at any rate less probable. A further con-
sideration is that, if we allow a connexion between our Epistle and
those of the other Apostles, it is easier to explain this on the sup-
position that the latter were acquainted with the manifesto of the
President of the Church at Jerusalem, rather than on the supposi-
tion that he was acquainted with a variety of writings addressed to
distant Churches. It is to be remembered also that these parallels
are not confined to the earlier or the more important Epistles of
St. Paul, and that some of the most striking parallels appear in
what are thought to be the latest writings in the N. T„ viz. the
Epistles of St. John, probably composed after the death of St.
James, and long after the probable date of his Epistle‚ as deduced
from other considerations.
