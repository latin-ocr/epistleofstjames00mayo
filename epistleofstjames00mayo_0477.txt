SWEARING.

From the form of the prohibition, we might suppose that St. James
took the same view 01 the siibject as St. Augustine, quoted in the
note, and forbade swearing, not so much because it was wrong in
itself, as because it was likely to lead to wrong, and therefore to con-
demnation. He could not have said 01 murder ‘ Do not kill lest you
fall under condemnationss At any rate by giving his warning in this
form he made it easier for the Jews to accept it. Whatever their
practice was, they would certainly allow that there was much careless
and irreverent swearing, and that this could not but be displeasiug to
God. St. James is, however, quoting Christ’s own words, and it is
therefore probable that he means ‘Whatever form 01 oath you
use, it will come under the prohibition 01 Christi! Are we to
understand from this that every kind 01 swearing is absolutely for-
bidden, that the Quakers, for instance, were right in refusing to take
an oath in a court 01 justice? This is not what we should gather
from the conduct of St. Paul and 01 Christ Himself. The former calls
God to witness that he is speaking the truth in more than one passage
<2 Cor. i. 23, xi. 31, Gal. i. 20, etc), and our Lord took the oath proposed
to Him in the words of the High Priest ‘ I adjure thee by the living
clod) So the angel in the Apocalypse is represented as swearing ‘ by
Him that hveth 101· ever and ever.' The same rule of interpretation
must be applied here as in the case 01 the other precepts 01 the Sermon
on the Mount. They supply an ideal standard, a goal to be aimed at,
but not a code 01 law to be immediately put into execution, regardless
01 existing circumstances, and 01 the manner in which their exact
observance would affect our carrying out the two great commandments
on which hang all the law and the prophets. Take for instance the
precept to turn the other cheek : if this is tried by the principle that
we should do to others as we would wish them to do to us, it is evident
that the last thing which a sane man could wish for himself or for one
whom he loved would be that he should be allowed to strike and
insult others with impunity. We have to disregard the letter, in
order to keep the spirit 01 the precept 5 which is that a Christian
should never act from mere vindictiveness. The law 01 love requires
us to act for the best interest 01 the offender, i.e. to act in such a way
as to induce him to avoid such faults in future. It is only where there
is sufficient generosity 01 character to make a man ashamed of striking
one who offers no resistance, that non-resistance becomes the fitting
course for a Christian, the right way 01 obey ing the law ‘ Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyselfi' Yet in proportion as a society becomes Chris-
tianized, it becomes more and more possible to practise non-resistance
without transgressing the higher law 01 love, which bids us always act
for the best interest of our neighbour. So with swearing: the right
state in a Christian community is that all should feel so strongly the
obligation 01 truth, that there should be no occasion for further sanc-
tion beyond the simple ‘yes' and ‘ no.’ Wherever there is need 01
more ‘it comes 01 eviL’ But often the standard of truthfulness is so
