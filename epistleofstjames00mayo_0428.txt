168 ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

the 031¹. unless the expression ‘before whom I stand' (in 1 Kings
xvii. 1) may be interpreted to mean ‘stand in prayer' as in J er. xv.
1, cf. Gen. xviii. 22, xix. 17. The duration of the drought here

given is tho same as that in Luke iv. 25, which is also found in ἶ
the Rabbinical tractate Jalkut Simeoni quoted by Schegg after ¹

Surenhusius, but in 1 Kings xviii. 1 it is said ‘after many days the

word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying...I will ·

send rain upon the earth) We are not told from what point the
third year is dated 3 if it is from the commencement of his sojourn
with the widow, as is generally supposed, and if the expression ‘end
of the days' in 1 Kings xvii. 7 (‘ it came to pass at the end of the days
that the brook dried up ’) is to be understood, as in other places, of a
year or more (see Keil in loc. and on xviii. 1, who compares Lev. xxv.
29, 1 Sam. xxvii. 7, J ud. xvii. 10), then the cessation of the drought
would take place in the fom³th year from its commencement, and
J ewish tradition would naturally fix on the middle of the fourth year,
as giving the half of the symbolical number, which is so prominent in
the prophecies of Daniel and in Apoc. xi. 3-9 (where it is said that the
two witnesses ‘have power to shut the heaven ἵνα μὴ ὑετὸς βρέχῃ during
the days of their prophecy,' i.e. 1260 days = 3} years). Others suppose
the calcul'ation to include the dry season preceding the first failure of
the regular periodical rains. It is simply a question as to the origin
of a Jewish tradition which undoubtedly existed at the time of the
Christian era, and which was probably excogitated by the early
rabbinical interpreters. In the fourth book of Esdras (vii. 39) Elijah
is cited as an example of intercession pro his qui pluviam acceperunt et
pro mortuo ut viveret.

ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς] Merely filling up the idea of ἔβρεξεν as in Gen. vii. 12
ἐγένετο ὁ ὑετὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, 1 I<ings xvii. 7, see above V. 5.

18. πάλιν upon-nugare] AS shown by hiS attibude (1 KingS XV1i1.42),
for which cf. Neh. viii. 6.

ὁούρανὸς ὑετὸν έὸωκεν.] The phrase ὑ. διδ. is used of God 1 Kings
xviii. 1, 1 Sam. xii. 17, Acts xiv. 17 οὐρανόθεν ὑετοὺς διδούς. Josephus
(Ant. xiv. 2. 1) tells a similar anecdote of Onias (13.6. 64) δίκαιος ἀνὴρ
καὶ θεοφιλὴς ὃς ἀνομβρίας ποτὲ οὔσης ηὔξατο τῷ Θεῷ...καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὗσεν, and
Epiphanius (p. 1046) of James himself, ποτὲ ἀβροχίας γενομένης ἐπῇρε
τὰς χεῖρας εἷς οὐρανὸν καὶ προσηύξατο καὶ εὐθὺς ὁ οὐρανὸς ἔδωκεν ὑετόν.
,016111 Al. (Βίτωνι. vi. 3, p. 753 P.) cites the legendary story of Aeacus
(Paus. ii. 28, p. 179) to the-same effect, as being derived from the
narrative of the miraculous rain sent in answer to Samuel's prayer
(1 Sam. xii. 17). Compare also the story of the Legio Fulminatrix
given by Euseb. ILE. v. 5.

ἐβλάστησεν] Τ116 aor. is here transitive, as in Gen. i. 11 βλαστησάτω
ἡ ’γῆ βοτάνην, Sir. xxiv. 17 ε’·γὼ ὡς ἄμπελος ἐβλάστησα χάριν, more
usually intr.‚ as Matt. xiii. 26, Heb. ix. 4. In later Greek the present
also is sometimes found in a transitive sense, see Lobeck on Aj. 1. 869.

19. ἐάν τις ἐν ὑμῖν πλανηθῇ] Rcturns to the subject of ver. 16. For
ἐν ὑμῖν see above v. 13. There seems no reason to give, as Alf„ to
πλανηθῇ here the passive force which it bears in Apoc. xviii. 23 ἐν τῇ
