clxxxviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

v, 470); V. 14· after προσεύχομαι (cf. Mark xvi. 18 ἐπὶ ἀρρώστους
χεῖρας ἐπιθήσουσιν, Acts viii. 17, Acts ix, 17, but more usually
with (lat. as in Mark v. 23, vii. 30).

πρός; for the post-Classical phrase πρός ὀλίγον ἰν. 14, cf. Plut.
Mor. 116 A, Justin M. Apol. i. 12 οὐκ ἄν τις τὴν κακίαν πρὸς
ὀλίγον ἡρεῖτο. There is only one instance of πρός with gen. in
NT. (Acts xxviii. 34), and six with the (lat.; but the acc. is some-
times used where we might have expected παρά with dat„ asin
Matt. xiii. 56 αἱ ἀδελφαὶ πρὸς ἡμᾶς εἰσίν.

ἐνῑ the following are unolassical, λαλεῖν and ἀλείφειν ἐν τῷ
ὀνόματι ν. 10, 14, πλούσιος ἐν πίστει i. 6 (where a Classical writer
would rather have used the simple gen. or dan), καυχάσθω ἐν τῷ
ὕψει i. 9 (where a Classical writer would rather have used ἐπί), ἐν
τῇ «γλώσσῃ εὐλογεῖν iii. 9 (instead of the simple dat). These
uses are shared by the other writers os the N .T.

Tonsos and mods—We have examples of the idiomatie use of
these in the gnomis: aorist, i. 11, 24, and the juxtaposition of aor.
and perf. in i. 24 κατενόησε καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν and of the pres. and
perf. in iii. 17 δαμάζεται καὶ δεδάμασται. The use of the moods
also conforms to the classical standard except that the optatLve is
absent, as it is also in Matthew‚ Mark, the Gospel anis-Epistles ‘of
John, and the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Apocalypse. W&
have no instance in our Epistle of such constructions as ἵνα
followed by a fut. ind, which we find in John xvii. 2 ἵναδώσει,
1 Pet. iii. 1 ἵνα κερδηθήσονται, and frequently in the Apoealypse;
still less of ἵνα with pres, ind. as in 1 Cor. iv. 6 ἵνα φυσιοῦσθε,
Gal. iv, 17 ἵνα ζηλοῦτε, though it is possible that these forms may
be used by mistake either for pres. subj. or fut. ind. (Winer p. 363).
A similar license is the use of ἐάν with indic. in 1 Thess. iii. 8 ἐὰν
ὑμεῖς στήκετε, Acts viii. 31 ἐὰν μή τις ὁδηνγήσει, Luke xix. 40 ἐὰν
οὗτοι σιωπήσουσιν, 1 John v. 15 ἐὰν οἴδαμεν ; of ὅταν with indic.
Apoc. iv. 9 ὅταν δώσουσιν, Mark xi. 19 ὅταν ἐγένετο, ver. 25 ὅταν
στήκετε, Mark iii. 11 ὅταν ἐθεώρουν. Again‚ St. James affords no
instanceof unclassical uses of the infinitive‚ such as ἐγένετο...
«ἐλθεῖν, sowcouimon in Luke; nor of the gen. of the article with inf.
instead of the simple inf. as in Luke xvii. 1 ἀνένδεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ
τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ ἐλθεῖν, Acts iii. 11 πεποιηκόσι τοῦ περιπατεῖν;
nor of ἵνα with subj. instead of simple inf. as in Matt. xviii. 6
συμφέρει αὐτῷ ἵνα κρεμασθῇ λίθος, J ohn' iv. :34 ἐμὸν βρῶμά ἐστιν
