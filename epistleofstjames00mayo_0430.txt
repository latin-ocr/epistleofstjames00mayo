170 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

lix. 8. It seems better therefore to translate ‘from the error of his
way.’ In classical prose the article would have been used both before
πλάνης and ὁδοῦ. The second article is omitted according to Hellenistic
usage because the noun is defined by the genitive of the personal
pronoun which follows it (cf. ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ just below, καρδίαν αὐτοῦ,
γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ above i. 26 aud &Vinea p. 155 fou), and the first article
is omitted by the ‘law of correlation' to suit the anarthrous ὁδοῦ, as in

p. 104. We find the same opposition of πλάνη to ἀλήθεια in 1 John
iv, 6 ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς
πλάνης.

σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ.] If this is the correct reading, the second αὐτοῦ
may either be understood of the subject of the verb (= Lat. suus, cf.
WViner, p. 188 foll , A. Buttmann, p. 97 foll„ Meisterhans Gr. Aa. [mola.
p. 122), or, more probably, it repeats the preceding αὑτοῦ, in which
case it may have been intentionally inserted to mark that this clause
refers to the sinner exclusively, allowing a wider scope to the next
clause 3 but in Β. αὐτοῦ comes after θανάτου1 instead of after ψυχήν,
suggesting that it may have arisen from a dittography. The future
σώσει is easier to understand if ψυχήν refers to the subject of the
verb. ‘ He who converts a sinner will be himself saved’ reads natural-
ly enough, the one action not being either identical or contemporaneous
with the other ; or again ‘ He who converts a sinner has thereby saved
a soul’ 3 but there is something of incongruity in the words ‘ He who
turns a sinner from the error of his way will save that sinner's soul
from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.' The object of the writer
is to stimulate and encourage the work of conversion to the utmost‚ but
by the use of the future instead of the present 2 or past he puts off the
issue of the work to an indefinite distance of time. [Bengel explains
it olim constabit, it will be seen on the day of judgment that he
has saved a soul from death] Otherwise salvation is regarded and
spoken of by the writers of the N.T. sometimes as a fact of the present,
sometimes of the future. See n. on next clause. For σ. ψ. ef. i. 21,
and for the absence of the article the last note and 1 Pet. iii. 3 ὀφθαλ-

the word ψυχή, Heb. x. 39 εἷς περιποίησιν ψυχῆς, 1 Pet. i. 9 κομιζόμενος
τὸ τέλος τῆς πίστεως, σωτηρίαν ψυχῶν, 2 Pet. ii. 8 ψυχὴν δικαίαν ἀνόμοις
ἔργοις ἐβασάνιζεν. The saving of the soul is attributed to the human
instrument in Rom. xi. 14, 1 Cor. vii. 16, 1 Tim. iv. 16, dcc,

ἐκ θανάτου] See above i. 15.

καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν] Α proverbial expression, which occurs also
in 1 Pet. iv. 8 ἀγάπη καλύπτει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν, and Which Resch
