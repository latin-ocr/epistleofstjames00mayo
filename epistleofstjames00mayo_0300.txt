νὸς εἷ ταῖς τύχαις ; ἀλλὰ τὸ φρόνημα μὴ καταπιπτέτω. πάντα σοι κατὰ νοῦν
χιι1ρεῖ,· μεταβολὴν εὐλαβοῦ, Sil-ac. lO. 21 πλούσιος καὶ ἔνδοξος καὶ πτωχός,
τὸ καύχημα αὐτῶν φόβος Κυρίου, Jer. ix. 23 μὴ καυχάσθω-ὁησοφὸς ἐν τῇ
σοφιίι αἰ»τοῦ,..καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ πλούσιος ἐν τῷ πλούτῳ αὐτοῦ, ‘but let
him 'that gloriebh glory 111 this, that he understandeth and knoweth
1110...>⁴:1ith the Lord,’ Rom. i. 16, 1 Pet. iv. 16, 1 Cor. vii. 22 ὁ ἐν
Κυρίῳ κληθεὶς δοῦλος, ἀπελεύθερος Κυρίου ἐστίν· ὁμοίως καὶ ὁ ἐλεύθερος κλη-
θεὶς, δοῦλός ἐστι Χριστοῦ, ὦ. vii. 29, Phil. iv. 12 οἶδα ταπεινοῦσθαι, οἶδα
καὶ περισσεύειν· ἐν παντὶ καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν μεμύημαι καὶ χορτάζεσθαι καὶ πεινᾶν,
καὶ περισσεύειν καὶ ὑστερεῖσθαι. The word καυχ. is much used by St.
Paul, generally 111 ει good senso z the Christian's boast is in God (Rom.
v. 11), in Clu-ist (Rom. xv, 17, 1 Cor. i. 31, 2 Cor. X. 17, Gal. vi. 14,
Phil. iii. 3 καυχώμενοι ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες), in the
hope of salvation (Rom. v. 2); δι.. Paul glories in his converts (2 Cor.
vii. 14, ix. 2, 3, 2 Thess. i. 4, Phil. ii. 16), in afflictions (Rom. v. 3),
iu infirmities (2 Cor. xii. 9) : hc apologises for boasbing in sels-justifi-
cation (2 Cor. xi„ xii.). There may be a. wrong boastingffi in God and
in the law (Rom. ii. 17, 23), a boasting of self-rigliteousness towards
God (Rom. iii. 27, iV. 2, 1 Cor. i. 29, iV. 7), an actual hoasting in sin
(1 Cor. v. 6), 01· 011 the ground of mere carnal advantages (2 Cor. xi.
18, Gal. vi. 13). It is used below of blaniable self-confidence (iv.

ὁ ἁδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινός.] WH. bracket the former ὁ, which is omitted
in Β. This would leave no doubt that ἀδελφός was a general term
applying to both πλούσιος and ταπεινός. Even with the article this is
the natural way of taking it. The objecbions will be considered below.
Ταπ. here refers to outward condition as in Luke i. 52 καθεῖλε δυναστάς
...ὕψωσε ταπεινούς, Rom. Xii. 16 μὴ τὰ ὑψηλὰ φρονοῦντες ἀλλὰ τοῖς ταπει-
νοῖς συναπαγόμενοι, cf. below ii. 5 ; in iv. 6 ταπ. refers ‘oo the character.

10. ὁ ὃε πλούσιος ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ.] ‘ Lei: the rich brother glory in
his humiliation as a Christian’: cf. Sir. 3. 18 ὅσῳ μέγας εἶ τοσούτῳ
ταπεινοῦ σεαυτὸν καὶ ἔναντι Κυρίου εὑρήσει χάριν, 1 Tim. Vi. 17 charge them
who are rich 111 this world μὴ ὑψηλοφρονεῖν μηδὲ ἠλπικέναι ἐπὶ πλούτου
ἀδηλότητι, Luke xvi. 15 τὸ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ὑψηλὸν βδέλυγμα ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ,
Malu. xviii. 4 ὅστις ταπεινώσει ἑαυτὸν...οῦτος ἔσται ὁ μείζων ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ
τῶν οὐρανῶν, il). xxiii. 12, 2 Cor. xi. 7 ἐμαυτὸν ταπεινῶν ἵνα ὑμεῖς ὑψώθητε,
also below iv. 10, Philo M. 1. p. 577 ταπεινώθητι ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς
(sc. of Sal-ah z ν11·δ110)καλὴν ταπείνωσιν, φρονήματος ἀλόγου καθαίρεσιν
ἔχουσαν, Xen. le. Lac. 8. 2 ἐν τῇ Σπάρτῃ οἶ κράτιστοι...τῷ ταπεινοὶ εἶναι
μεγαλύνων-παι. We might understand ταπ. with reference bo the loss of
position, tho scol-11 which 0110 who became a. Chrisbian would have 130
suffer from his unhclicving fellow-couutrymen (l Cor. iv. 10-13); but>
it seems better to refer it, like ὕψος above, to the intrinsic effect of
Clu-istianity iu changing 0111· view of life. As the despised poor learns
sols-respect, so tho prond rich learns self-abasement, cf. Luke xxii. 26
“ ὁ ἡγούμενος ὡς ὁ διακονῶν. Alf„ after Rode, Pom, Hubher aud Others,
‹listinguishes ὁ πλούσιος from ὁ ἀδελφός on the ς1·01111(1(1) that the rich in
this cpistle arc always spoken of in ternis of great, severiby (ii. 6, ν.1 foll.)3
