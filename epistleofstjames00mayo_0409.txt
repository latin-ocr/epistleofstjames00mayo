V 5-7 NOTES 149

14, vii. 52, xxii. 14, 1 Pet. iii. 18, Luke xxiii. 47. These passages
might suggest that we have here a direct reference to the Crucifixion‚
11111 in any case 5 δίκαιος must be regarded as generic and not confined
to one individual. Thus the words are applicable to the writer him-
self, who was known to all the Jews as the Just3 cf. the account
of his death in Euseb. ILE. ii. 23, taken from Hegesippus: διὰ τὴν
ὑπερβολὴν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ ἐκαλεῖτο Δίκαιος καὶ Ὠβλίας, the Jews
ran upon him crying out ὢ ὣ καὶ ὁ δίκαιος ἐπλανήθη...λιθάσωμεν τὸν
δίκαιον, herein fulfilling the prophesy in Isa. iii. 10 (as Hegesippus
says). One of the priests in vain tried to save him with the words
παύσασθε, τί ποιεῖτε ‚· εὔχεται ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ὁ δίκαιος. See below V. 16.

οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν.] The subject here is 5 δίκαιος. Α more regular
construction would be οὐκ ἀντιτασσόμενον, but the abrupt change to
direct statement is a far more graphic way of putting the fact. For
the change from aor. to present we may compare the similar passage
in Isa. liii. 5-7 ἐτραυματίσθη διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶιι...καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ κεκα-
κῶσθαι οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα· ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη, καὶ ὡς ἀμνὸς
...οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα. The present brings the action before our eyes
and makes us dwell upon this, as the centra] point, in contrast with
the accompanying circumstances. Others (Hofmann, Erdmann, dvc.)
take 1118 verb as an impersonal passive, like ἀφεθήσεται below v. 15,
meaning ‘no opposition is needed,' ‘you have your way’, but no
instance of this use has been pointed out. Itis the middle, not the
active, which means to resist, as above iv. 6, and Rom. xiii. 2, Acts
xviii. 6, 1 Kings xi. 34, Hos. i. 6. The only example of the passive in
the LXX. is Prov. iii. 15, where it means ‘ shall not be compared with

her,' lit. ‘ set against her.' The clause is made interrogative by WH., as f

by Bens0n‚ understanding 5 Κύριος (cf. above iv. 6),1 which was actually
substituted for οὐκ by Bentley (ΟΚΣ for ΟΥΚ), but I agree with Herder
that this gives a less natural and a less pathetic sense than the reading
of the MSS. For the thought see Matt. v. 39, Rom. xii. 19, 1 Pet.
ii. 23 3 and for asyndeton the Essay on Grammar and ii. 13 above.

7. μακροθυμήσατε οὖν] Turning to the oppressed brethren St. J ames
urges patience upon them by the example of ‘the just‚⁷ and because it
is now the last time, the day of slaughter, and their cries have gone
up to the Lord of Sabaoth. As γλυκύθυμος means ⁶ sweet-tempered,⁷
ὀξύθυμος ‘quick-tempered,’ so μακρόθυμος is literally ‘long-tempered,⁷
the opposite to our ‘ short-tempered.' In NT. we find μακρόθυμος used
of God (Rom. ii. 4, 1 Pet. iii. 20), of man <below v. 10 and 2 Cor. vi. 6,
also the adv. μακροθύμως Acts XXVi. 3). The verb μακροθυμέω is used
of God 2 Pet. iii. 9, of man 1 Cor. xiii. 4. ln LXX. we find
μακρόθυμος of God Exod. xxxiv. 6, Ps. ciii. 8: of man Prov. xiv. 29,
xvi. 32, xix, 11. Theword is rare in classical Greek, but μακροθυμία
occurs in Menander p. 203 Mein, and μακροθυμέω in Plutarch. On the
relation of μακροθυμία to ὑπομονή see Lightfoot on Col. i. 11, and
2 Tim. iii. 11,

ἐ’ως τῆς παρουσίας] ἕως seems 10 be first used as 11 preposition by

¹ Dr. Abbott would understand ,ὁ δίκαιος with much the sain(- sense.
