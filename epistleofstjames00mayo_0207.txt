ORDER or WoRDs.

(1) of substantive and attribute3 (2) of governing and governed
nouns 3 (3) of subject and predicate3 (4) of governing verb and
case.

(1) The adjective generally follows immediately on its sub-
stantive, as in i. 4 ἔργον τέλειον, i. 8 ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, ii. 2 ἀνὴρ
χρυσοδακτύλιος, ii. 2 ἐσθῆτι λαμπρᾷ, but we find also the
adjective preceding in i. 12 μακάριος ἀνήρ, iii. 2 τέλειος ἀνὴρ,
ii. 2 ῥυπαρᾷ ἐσθῆτι, &c.‚ and always in the case of πᾶς. It is
unusual for the substantive to be separated from the adjective by
an intervening verb, as in i. 2 ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε
ποικίλοις, iv. 6 μείζονα δίδωσιν χάριν, iii. 13 «γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ,
iv. 12 εἷς ἔστιν νομοθέτης, ν. 17 Ἠλείας ἄνθρωπος ἣν ὁμοιοπαθὴς
ἡμῖν [here, however, it is possible to make a pause between ἄνθρωπος
and ὁμοιοπαθής ‘Elijah was a man, of like passions with us’]. In
these cases the adjective ismade more prominent by separation,
though it is probable that a feeling of rhythm had a good deal to
do with the departure from the usual order.

(2) Omitting the genitive of the pronoun, which has been
already dealt with, we find the genitive placed immediately after
the governing noun in 50 cases as compared with three in which
it precedes, the latter being i. 1 Θεοῦ δοῦλος, iii. 3 τῶν ἵππων τοὺς
χαλινούς, i. 17 τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα. In one instance the governing
noun is separated by an intervening verb from the governed‚ τὴν
«γλῶσσαν οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται ἀνθρώπων, where greater
emphasis is given to ἀνθρώπων by its position.

(3) Where the subject (not being a relative pronoun) is
expressed, it precedes the predicative verb in about 55 cases, and
follows it in about 20. When the predicate is expressed by the
substantive verb and complement‚ the subject precedes the verb in
about 16 cases and follows in about 8. I do not here take note of
cases in which the verb is omitted, for which see Ellszsspsz's above. As
a rule the subject precedes the complement (predicative substantive
or adjective), but we have the following exceptions: i. 26 μάταιος
ἡ θρησκεία, i. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ αὕτη ε’στίν, ii. 19 εἷς ἐστὶν
ὁ Θεός, iii. 6 ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ νγλῶσσα καθίσταται. V. 11
πολύσπλαγχνός ἐστιν ὁ Κύριος. In oblique predication, where
subject and complement come under the government of a
