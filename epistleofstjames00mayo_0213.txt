ΟΝ THE STYLE OF ST. JAMES clxxxix

ἴνα ποιῶ τὸ θέλημα, Luke 1. 43 πόθεν μοι τοῦτο ἵνα ἔλθῃ ἡ μήτηρ,
1 Cor. iv. 3 ἐμοὶ εἰς ἐλάχιστόν ἐστιν ἵνα ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀνακριθῶ, or
insteaekofthe inf. with art. explaining the purport of what pre-
cedes, as in Phil. i. 9 τοῦτο προσεύχομαι, ἵνα ἡ ἀνγάπη περισσεύσῃ,
1 John iv. 17 ἐν τούτῳ τετελείωται ἡ ἀνγάπη, ἵνα παρρησίαν
ἔχωμεν, or where we should have expected the inf. with ὥστε,
eg. Gal. V. 17 ταῦτα ἀλλήλοις ἀντίκειται, ἵνα μὴ ἃ ἐὰν θέλητε
ποιῆτε, 1 Th. V. 4⁴ οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σκότει, ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς
κλέπτας καταλάβῃ.

011 the whole I should be inclined to rate the Greek of this
Epistle as approaching more nearly to the standard of Classical
purity than that of any other book of the N.T., with the exception
perhaps of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The author of the latter
has no doubt greater copiousness‚ and inore variety of construction&
he is also occasionally very idiomatic‚ as in the phrase ἔμαθεν ἀφ’
ὧν ἔπαθεν v. ὃς but while the distinction between μή and οὐ 15
carefully preserved in our Epistle‚ we find in the Hebrews μή used
incorrectly after ἐπεί ix. 17 ἐπεὶ μὴ τότε (al. μήποτε) ἰσχύει, ὅτε
ζῇ ὁ διαθέμενος, and with the participle xi. 8 ἐξῆλθεν μὴ ἐπιστά-
μενος, ver. 13 κατὰ πίστιν ἀπέθανον μὴ κομίσαντες, ver. 27 πίστει
κατέλιπεν Αἴγυπτον μὴ φοβηθεὶς τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ βασιλέως (in con-
trast with James i. 25). Again, the latter writer is less accurate in
his use of the moods and tenses than our author. Thus we find the
aor. with οὔπω 111 Χ11. 4, where a Classical writer would have used the
perfect, οὔπω μέχρις αἵματος ἀντικατέστητε...καὶ ἐκλέλησθε τῆς
παρακλήσεως; we find ὅταν with the aor. subj. followed by pres.
ind. in i. 6 ὅταν πάλιν εἰσανγιίνγῃ τὸν πρωτότοκον εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην
λέτγει, where ὅταν ἐξανγάτγῃ seems to be equivalent to εἰσάΎωνῑ we
find irregular uses of the inf. in ii. 3 ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα λαλεῖσθαι,
11. 15 διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν, ix. 24 εἰς οὐρανὸν εἰσῆλθεν νῦν ἐμφανισθῆ-
ναι τῷ προσώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ, vi. 10 οὐ ιγὰρ ἄδικος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπιλαθέσθαι
τοῦ ἔργοικ 1νο find post-Classical uses of the prepositions‚ eg. παρὰ
after the comparative in i. 4, iii. 3 and elsewhere3 εἰς used with
persons, ii. 3 εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐβεβαιώθη, εἰς τὸ used of the consequence

Wlffssec νοοῦμεν κατηρτίσθαι τοὺς αἰῶνας ῥήματι Θεοῦ εἰς τὸ
μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων ὙεὙονέναι; ἀπό used where a classica] writer
would have written διά with acc. v, 7 εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλα-
β-είας; not to mention the use of such a Pauline anacoluthon as
xiii. 5 ἀφιλάργυρος ὁ τρόπος, ἀρκούμενοι τοῖς παροῦσιν. >
