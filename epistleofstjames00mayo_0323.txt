I 21, 23 NOTES 65

only found six times in N.T., of which four are in St. J ames, Grotius
quotes a rabbinical saying to the effect that there are two crowns, one
of hearing, the other of doing.1 Cf. also Taylor’s Jewish Fafflers, p.
63 ‘ R. Ohananiah used to say whosesoever works are in excess of his·
wisdom, his wisdom stands3 and whosesoever wisdom is in excess of
his works, his wisdom stands not '3 ib. p. 75.

ἀκροαταί] Regularly used of an attendant at a lecture, but distin-
guished from μαθητής by Isocr. ad Nic. 17 ποιητῶν ἀκροατὴς, σοφιστῶν
μαθητὴς γίγνου, ib. p. 405 B. : similarly ἀκουστής and aecclitor. As
Dr. Plummer observes, we naturally think of the reading of the
Scriptures in the synagogue, on which the Jews laid such sti-ess. The
word is used three times by St. J ames, only once besides in N.T.
(Rom. ii. 16).

παραλογιζόμενοι] The only other passage in which it occurs in N.T.
is Col. 11. 4 ἵνα μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς παραλογίζηται ἐν πιθανολογίᾳ, Which Lightfoot
explains ‘ lead you away by salse reasoning.' In LXX. it is more loosely
used, as 1 Sam. xxviii. 12, where the witch of Endor says to Saul ἵνα τί
παρελογίσω με ;

ἑαυτούς.] Regularly used in N.T., and often by classical authors, for
the plural reflexive of the lst and 2nd persons: cf. NViner, p. 187 foll..
Vorst. p. 68.

23. ὅτι.] Here = γὰρ, giving the reason for the injunction ‘ do not be
mere hearers: because on such the word has no abiding influence. The
causal connexion denoted by ὅτι, which is sometimes so close as to make
even a comma unnecessary (eg. Matt. xx. 15 ὃ ὀφθαλμός σου πονηρός
ἐστιν ὅτι ἐγὼ ἀγαθός εἶμι ,·), is sometimes so loose as to allow of its being
separated from what precedes by a full stop, as in Mark iii. 3 ἀμὴν λέγω
ὑμῖν...ἆμαρτήματος. ὅτι ἔλεγον πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον ἔχει, Luke xi. 18, ib.
xiv. 11, Heb. viii. 10.

οὐ ποιητής.] Οὐ is used even in classical Greek after εῖ, when, as
here, it may be considered to coalesce with the particular word 01·
phrase to which it is joined, and not to affect the condition generally
(this takes place most easily with such words as θέλω or ἐάω), or when the
negative conception is immediately contrasted with its positive, as below
iii. 2 πολλὰ πταίομεν ἅπαντες. εἴ τις οὗ πταίει, 01· When it may be regarded
as parenthetical, being most exactly represented by the insertion of
such a phrase as ‘ I do not say.⁷ The same rule applies where the con-
ditionis assumed to be the fact, εἷ being equivalent to ἐπεί 01· ὅτι. But
beside these cases, in which οὐ was admissible in classical Greek, the
later Greek employs εἰ οὗ instead of εἷ μή as more emphatic, the latter
being generally used without a verb (out of ninety—three examples cited
by Bruder only fourteen are followed by a verb) in the sense of ‘but ’
or ‘ except.’ Of εἶ οὗ Bruder cites thirty-one examples, omitting how-
ever this verse and iii. 2. On the other hand, μή is always used with

¹ [On Exod. xxiv. 7, which ends (lit.) ‘we will do and we will hear,' it is written
(T. B. Shabbath SSa) that “when Israel put ‘ we will do' before ⁴ we will hem-,where
came 60 myriads of ministering angels, and attached to each one of Israel two
crowns, one corresponding to ‘ we will do' and the other to ‘we will hem-,¹ and
