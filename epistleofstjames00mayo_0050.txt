xxvi THE EPlS'l'LE OF ST. JAMEs

chhilstorit: In the last passage the grounds for accepting the explanation

Γ a 0⁰ s. mentioned, (2) that it is in harmony with the sentiment of the
writer. The latter we shall shortly consider under the general
head which follows: the former raises the question of the his-
torica] credibility of the Apocryphal Gospels, on which Ι need
only quote Bp. Lightfoot's words in reference to the stories of our
Lord's childhood contained in them : ‘ these accounts, so far as they
step beyond the incidents narrated in the Canonical Gospels‚ are pure
fabrication‚' but still they may fairly be used as negative evidence
against the Hieronymian view for ‘the fabrication would hardly
have taken this form, had that view been received or even known
when they were written ' (bc. p. 275).

³5· to the Epiphanian theory. Omitting the Apocryphal Gospels‚
the general result is as follows. Of pre—Hieronymian writers
seven understand the brothers of the Lord as sons of J oseph
by a former wife, viz. Clement of Alexandria (about 200 A.D.)‚
Origen (d. 2553), Eusebius the historian (d. about 340), Hilary of
Poitiers (d. 368), Ambrosiaster (about 375), Gregory Nyssen (about
370), and Epiphanius, whose treatise on the subject was written
some time before 374. Jerome put forward his theory in 383, and
he is followed by Augustino and the Latin Fathers generally; but
Ambrose, writing in 393, still adheres to the old view, though he
considers the particular relationship of little consequence. In the
Eastern Chureh Chrysostom, who in his earlier writings favours the
Epiphanian view, comes round to J erome in the later, and Theo-
doret may be mentioned on the same side; but the later Greek
Fathers are almost all on the side of Epiphanius; and the Greek,
Syriam, and Coptic Calendars mark the distinction between J ames
the brother of the Lord and J ames the son of Alphaeus by assign-
ing a separate day to each. This distinction is also maintained,
apart from any statement as to the exact relationship impsied by
