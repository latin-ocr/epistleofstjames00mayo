THE AUTHOR xli

What do we gather from all this with regard to the life and cha-

racter of James the Just, the son of that Joseph of whom also it is ctis

recorded that 116 was ‘a just man ⁷ 2 The word ‘just’ implies one cume tr

who not only observes but loves the law, and we may be sure that
the reverence for the Jewish law, which shows itself in our Epistle‚
was learnt in the well-ordered home of Nazareth. There, too, he may
have acquired, with the full sanction of his parents, who would gladly
devote the eldest-born of Joseph in such marked way to 13116 future
service of God and his Messiah, those strict ascetic habits which
tradition ascribes to him. But the constant intercourse with Him
who was full of grace and truth, in childhood as in manhood, must
have prepared J ames to find in the Ten Commandments no mere
outward regulations, but an inner law of liberty and love written in
the heart. That deep interest in the mysteries of the kingdom,
that earnest search after truth which led the child J esus to romain
behind in thetemple, both listening to the doctors and asking 1116111
questions, must surely have had its effect upon his brother.
Whatever means of instruction were within reach of the home at
Nazareth would, we may feel certain, have been eagerly taken ad-
vantage of by all its inmates. While accepting, therefore, the view
which seems to be best supported, that J esus and his brothers
usually spoke Aramaic, we are surely not bound to suppose that
with towns like Sepphoris and Tiberias in their immediate vicinity,
with Ptolemais, Scythopolis} and Gadara at no great distance, they
remained ignorant of Greek. In the eyes of the Scribes they might
‘ never have learnt letters,' since they had not attended the rabbi-
nical schools at Jerusalem; but the ordinary education of Jewish
children and the Sabbath readings in the synagogue would give
sufficient start to enable any intelligent boy to carry 06 1115 studies
for himself ; while the example of Solomon and the teaching of
the so-called ‘ sapiential ² books, with which the writer of our
Epistle was familiarly acquainted, held up the pursuit of knowledge
and wisdom as 1116 highest duty of man.2 Not many years before,
four of the most accomplished literary men of the time were
