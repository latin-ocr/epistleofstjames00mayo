152 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

is found Matt. vii. 22, Jer. xliv, (li.) 16 ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησας πρὸς ἡμᾶς
ὀνόματι Κυριόυ. This· approaches the force Of ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι (depending
on his mune, ic. through his power), which occurs both in N.T., as in
Acts iv. 17, 18, and in classical writers, as Dem. Lept. 495. 7, lsae. 58.
28 and 85. 3 with Schoniann's n. Diodorus xviii. 57 has γράψας
ἐπιστολὴν ἐκ τοῖ’ τῶν βασιλέων ὀνόματος.

1 1. μακαρίζομεν τοὺς ὑπομείναντας] As ini. 12, and Dan. xii. 12, cf. Matt.
xxiv. 13 ὁ δὲ ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος οὗτος σωθήσεται. Ὺπομονή is found in
connexion with μακροθυμία 2 Cor. vi. 4ff.‚ Col. i. 11, 2 Tim. iii. 10.

Ἰώβ] Job is not an example of what we should call patience except
in his first acceptance of calamity (i. 21, ii. 10). We should rather say
that his complaint in ch. iii„ his indignation against his friends for
their want of faith in him, his agony at the thought that God had
forsaken him, were symptoms of an extremely sensitive, vehement,
impatient character, which has very little either of Stoic ἀπάθεια 01· of
Christian πραΰτης, but excites our admiration by its passionate outbursts
of exalted feeling. The word means however endurance, and may well
110 applied to thc persistent trust in God shown in ch. xiii. 10, 15, xvi.
19-21, xix. 25 foll. It corresponds to ἐκαρτέρησε, used of Moses, Heb.
xi. 25. For the reference to Joh, cf. Tanchuma 29. 4 ap. Schoettgen
ΙΙ. Η. 1009 foll. si pauper stat in tentatione et non recalcitrat, ille duplum
accipiet vitt 'mundo futuro. Em cujus escemplo Ιιοο addiscis? Eaeemplo
Jobi qui tentatus est in hoc mundo, Deus vero duplum ipsi reddidit.

ἠκούσατε] So in the Sel-mon on the Mount ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἐρρήθη. It
is properly used of oral instruction in the synagogue. The aor. here
must bc translated, as in many other instances, by the Eng. perfect.

τὸ τέλος Κυρίου εἴδετε] ‘ Yon are acquainted with the story and have
scen in it how God makes all turn out for good.' Alf. reads ἴδετε with
ΑΗΖ, translating ‘see also‚’ which gives a very uncouth sentence, and
would imply that they could have heard the story without seeing
1110 end. On the confusion between ει and ι 111 the MSS. see note on
iii. :3 ἴδε. Ewald understands τέλος as ‘das Ziel welches Gott bei J ob's
Leiden hatte, niunlich seine Liebe zu zeigen‚’ so Schegg and others,
comparing 1 Tim. i. 5 τὸ τέλος τῆς παραγγελίας ἐστὶν ἂγαπή, but
it is better understood <as in the Peshitto version emitum, quem ei
feci! dominus) of the cnd appointed hy the Lord, viZ. Job’s final
prosperity and the declaration of his integrity against Satan and the
friends, cf. Heb. mii. 7 ὧν ἀναθεωροῦντες τὴν ἔκβασιν τῆς ἀναστροφῆς
μιμεῖσθε τὴν πίστιν und Jol) xlii. 12 ὁ δὲ Κύριος εὗλόγησε τὰ ἔσχατα Ἰώβ
ἦ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν, 2 Cor. xi. 15 ὧν τὸ τέλος ἔσται κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, 1 Pet.
iv. 17 τί τὸ τέλος τῶν ἀπειθούντων; For the subjective genitive Κυρίου
ef. 1 Pet. iii. 14 τὸν φόβον αὐτῶν μὴ φοβήθητε, 2 Cor. xi. 26 κινδύνοις
ποταμῶν, λῃστῶν, κ.τ.λ., Test.. Gad. p. 685 ὅρον Κυρίου ἐκδέξασθε ‘wait
the limit appointed by the Lord,’ so δικαιοσύνη, εἰρήνη Θεοῦ. Many of
the older commentators and Bassott take Κυρίου of Clu-ist, contrasting
what the readers had seen of his sufferings with what they had heard
about dol). But this, instead of giving one perfect illustration of the
result of suffering rightly borne, gives two imperfect and barely intel-
ligible illustrations. If τέλος is supposed to refer to tho Resurrection
