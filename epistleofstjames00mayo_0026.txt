ii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

while St. Peter on the contrary ‹lwells exclusively on the example
of Christ (cf. 1 Pet. ii. 19—24‚ iv. 12-14). So in urging the
duty of prayer reference is made, not (as in Heb. v. 7) to the
promises or the praycrs of Christ, but to the prayer of Elijah: the
duty of kindness‚ and the warning against evil-speaking in ch. iii.
are based not on the example of Christ and the thought of our
common brotherhood in him (as in 1 Pet. ii. 2³3, Rom. xii. 5, Eph.
iv. 25), but 011 the parablcs of nature, on the fact that man was
created in the image of God, and on general reasoning: and again
(in iv. 11, 12) speaking evil of a brother is condemned as putting a
slight on the Law, not as causing pain to Christ. No mention is
made of the death or resurrection of Christ, or of the doctrines of
the Incarnation and Atonement. To a careless reader the toric of
the Epist-le, as a whole, seems scarcely to rise above the level of the
Old Testament3 Christian ideas are still clothed in Jewish forms.
Thus the LaW, called for the sake of distinction ‘ the law of liberty '
‹›r ‘the royal laW,' seems to stand in place of the Gospel or even of
Christ himself (ii. 8413, iv, 11) : the love of the world is condemned
in the language of the Old Testament as adultery against God.

This contrast rises to its highest point in treating of the relation
between Faith and Works (ii. 14-26). While St. Paul writes

(Rom. iii. 28) ‘ We reckon therefore that a man is justified by saith 2

apart from the works of the laW‚' the language of St. J ames is (ii.

24) ‘Ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by ⁴

saith only? And while the case of Abraham is cited in Rom. iv.
3, 153, 16 in proof of the doctrine of justification by saith, and the
case of Rahab is cited for the same purpose in Heb. xi. 31,
St. James makes use of both to prove that man is justified by works
(ii. 25). Ι shall have to go more fully into these questions here-
after‚ and shall then point out some considerations which will to a
certain extent qualify tho first impression left on the mind by a
perusal of the Epistlc; but speaking generally we may safely say
that it has a more J cwish cast than any other writing of the New
Testament‚ and that thc author must have been ono who would be
more in sympathy with the Judaizing party and more likely to
exerc-ise an influonce over them than any of the three great leaders,
Peter, Paul or John. -
