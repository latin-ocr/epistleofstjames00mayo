164 THE EPISTLE OF ST. J AMES

custom in monasberies,¹ and the Moravian Societies (which Wesley
took as the pattern for the Methodisb Classes) used to meet two or
three times a week ‘ to confess their faults one bo another and bo pray
for one another that they might be healed.' The word Exomologesis
was horrowed by bhe Latin Christians, cf. Tertull. Orat. 7. For further
information see articles on Exomologesis and Penitence in D.C.A. ¹
ὅπως ἰαθῆτε] For the use of ἰᾶσθαι in reference to ‘che diseases of the
soul ef. Heb. xii. 13, 1 Pet.. ii. 24, Mati. xiii. 15, Deut. xxx. 3 ἰάσεται
Κύριος τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου, 2 Chron. xxx. 20, Isa. vi. 10, lvii. 19, Sir.
xxviii. 3, ὥσ, Herm. Sim. 9. 23, also t-he remarkable parallel in Arrian
Anah. vii. 29 μόνη γὰρ ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ ἴασις ἁμαρτίας ὁμολογεῖν τε ἁμαρτάνοντα
καὶ δῆλον εἶναι ἐπ’ αὐτῷ μεταγιγνώσκοντα. If the word is understood
literally of bodily disease, as by De Wette and Huther, the connexion >
of thoughb is perhaps closer, keeping to ‘che subject of the miraculous
cure, which is spoken of in the preceding verse and seems to be
referred bo in the words which follow, dwelling on the miraculous ⁴
power of bhe prayer of Elijah. Δ
πολὺ ἰσχύει δέησις δικαίη] Compare the saying of R. Jehuda poeniten-
tia potest aliquid secl preces possunt omnia, and the promise in Malaia. xvii. „
20, 21, ib. xxi. 21, 22, Mark xi. 22-26, Phil. iv. 13, 1 John v. 14—16, Psa.

φροσύνη παρὰ Θεῷ ἰσχύει. For δικαίου of. V. 6 : he is one who by saith
fulfils the νόμος ἐλευθερίας. Bp. Wordsworth (Stucl. Bib. Ῑ. 128) and
Ronsch (Das Neue Test. Tertullinus) hold that Tertullian never quotes Ι
from Si. James ; but is there nob a reference to this passage in the ³
De Oratione c. 282 We find there lsb an allusion to the prayer of
Elijah ‘retro oratio imbrium utilia yffolcibebat, and 2nd ‘co the much-
availing ‘prayer of righteousness': mmo vero oratio justitiae omnem
ircim Dei avertit, and ihs employmenb defunctorum animas de ipso ‘mortis
itinere vocare, debiles reformare, aeyros remediare... Eadem diluit Ι
delicta, tentationes repellit: cf. above ver. 15 and below ver. 20, also .

ἐνεργουμένη] Is this passive or middle2 Of the former we have '
examples l Esdr. ii. 19 ἐνεργεῖται τὰ κατὰ τὸν ναόν ‘bhe works of the

καὶ θέλει τοῦτον ἐνεργεῖσθαι καὶ δίκαιον οἶδεν, δεδήλωκεν αὐτὸς ὁ Θεός, Arisb. 5

i. 13. 5 ὁ πόλεμος ἐνηργεῖτο, ib. iX. 13. 9 δι’ ὧν ἐνεργηθήσεται τὸ κριθέν, ·
J nstin Apol. i. 12 πεπείσμεθα ἐκ δαιμόνων ταῦτα ἐνεργεῖσθαι, Trypli. 78 ,
