that the habit of mind which showed itself in the use of parables
was not acquired after manhood. The love of nature, the sympathy
in all human interests, the readiness to find ‘sermons in stones
and good in everything' must have characterized the child J esus
and coloured all his intercourse with his fellows from his earliest
years. It is interesting, therefore, to find the same fondness for
figurative speech in the Epistles of his brothers St. J ames and St.
J ude This will be fully treated of m the subsequent Essay on Style.
Another marked feature of our Epistle 1s the close connexion 601ξῗ11121ξξ611
between it and the Sermon on the Mount, in which our Lord ath} ⁸¹thss 111111
the commencement of his careel, laid down the plinciples of the ¹¹¹2 {Seghss
kingdom of God which he carne to establish on earth. This will Mou ¹1·ss
be shown in detail further on. It will suffice to refer here to the
more general harmony between the two as to the spiritual view of
the Law (James i. 25, ii. 8, 12, 13, Matt. v. 17-44), the blessings of
adversity (James i. 2, 3, 12, ii. 5, V. 7, 8, 11, Matt. v. 3—12), the
dangers and the uncertainty of wealth (James i. 10, 11, ii. 6, 7, iv.
4, 6, 13-16, ν. 1-6, Matt. vi. 19-21‚ 24-34), the futility of a mere pro-
fession of religion (James i. 26, 27, Matt. vi. 1-7), the contrast he-
tween saying and doing (James i. 22—25, ii. 14-26. iii. 13, 18, Matt.
vii. 15-27), the true nature of prayer (James i. 5-8, iv. 3, v. 13-18,
Matt. vi. 6-13), the incompatibility between the love of the world
and the love of God (James ii. 5, iii. 6, iv. 4-8, Matt. vi. 24), the
need to forgive others if we would be forgiven ourselves (James ii.
12, 13, Matt. vi. 14, 15), the tree known by its fruits (James iii. 11,
12, Matt. vii. 16-20), the interdiction of oaths (James v. 12, Matt.
V. 34-37), and of censoriousness (James iv. 11, 12, Matt. vii. 1-5),
the praise of singleness of aim (James i. 8, iv. 8, Matt. vi. 22, 23).
It is to be noticed that, close as is the connexion of sentiment and
even of language in many of these passages, it never amounts to
actual quotation. It is like the reminiscence of thoughts often
uttered by the original speaker and sinking into the heart of the
hearer, who reproduces them in his own manner. And the Sermon
on the Mount is made up of what may be called the common-
places of Christ's teaching, the fundamental ideas with which he
commenced his ministry.
But these reminiscences are not confined to the Sermon on 1³01,
