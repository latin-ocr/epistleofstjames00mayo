xiv THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

the majority of them, and need not be understood to apply strictly
to each separate brother; that it is consistent therefore with the
supposition that J 1111103, for instance, was an Apostle, provided that
Simon and Jude were not Apostles; the answer is that the theory
derives part of its seeming strength from the coincidence of the
names of three of the brethren ofthe Lord and three of the Twelve
Apostles. But it is impossible to suppose repeated assertions to
be made respecting the brethren of the Lord, which (on this
supposition) are untrue of him who was by far the best known
“0¹¹¹‘OE among them. Lastly it is to be noticed that neither sames nor

dames nor

Ίζῖξῆξζζᾛζξῗ (3) It has been shown that probability is strongly against a
'ssssfflfff‘ffis cousin of the Lord being habitually known as ἁδελφὸς Κυρίου,

‘J'i'ffl'ssffi and that the evidence is over-whelming against the brothers of the
¹¹¹⁰t¹¹⁰¹² Lord being included in the Twelve. Scarcely less strong is the
argument against the Hieronymian view drawn from what we
read of the relation of the brethren of the Lord to his mother.
Though, according to this view, their own mother Mary was living
at the time of the crucifixion‚ and though there is nothing to show
that their father was not also living, yet they are never found in
the company of their parents or parent, but always with the
Vir-gin. They move with her and her divine Son to Capernaum
and form one household there (John ii. 12); they take upon
themselves to control and check the actions of Jesus; they go
with Mary ‘to take him‚' when it is feared that his mind is
becoming unhinged. They are referred to by the neighbours as
members of his family in exactly the same terms as his mother
T¹¹0¹‘·³ffi· and his reputed father; the neighbours, it is evident, have no

‘iiiiirihii-intri-ie more doubt as to the one relationship than they have as to the

themafivrual to suggest anything out of the common order of nature. It is
‘emon‘ suggested indeed that the Virgin and her sister were both widows
at this time, and had agreed to form one household3 bnt this is

mere hypothesis, and is scarcely consistent with the remarks of the
neighbours, who endeavour to satisfy themselves that -Jesus was

not entitled to speak as 110 had done, by calling to mind those
