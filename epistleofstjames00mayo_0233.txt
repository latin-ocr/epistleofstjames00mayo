DID ST. ‚JAMES WRITE IN GREEK ΟΒ ΑΒΑΜΑΙΟΊ ccvii

for ἐνεργουμένη v, 16, the omission of κενῶς, and the translation
of ἐπιποθεῖ by convalescit in iv, 5, are also cited as evidences of a
different original}

Before dealing with these arguments it may be well to turn to
the Greek text itself and see whether it reads like an original or a
translation. It must be granted that this is not altogether an
easy matter to decide. There are no doubt many translations
which tell their character at once3 translations from Oriental
langilage8‚ which seem to make it their aim to exhibit in the
crudest colours the contrast of eastern and western thought and
speech; translations from the German, which faithfully preserve
the heavy prolixity of the original ; or translations which betray a
different origin by their affectation of F rench elegance and light-
ness. The case however even here would be complicated if it were
a question whether a particular book were an original, written,
say, by an Anglicized German, or a translation from the German
by an Englishman3 and this is really the question before us; for
all that could be claimed for our Epistle, supposing it not to be a
translation from the Aramaic, is that it was written by a Greek-
speaking Jew. So much is plain from the style and vocabulary,
even if we were entirely in the dark as to the writer. There is
however nothing in'it of the scrupulous anxiety of a translator
cautiously treading in the footsteps of his author. On the con-
trary, it is written in strong, simple Greek, used with no slight
rhetorical skill by one who has something of his own to say, and
says it with perfect freedom. If a translation, it is a translation of
the stamp of our authorized English version, or of Luther’s German
version, which have become the recognized standards and models

of excellence in their respective langii-ages. But the frequent use
of the different figures of speech, alliteration, homoeoteleuton, «ᾖα,
to which attention has been called in a previous chapter, is an
ornament which a translator is hardly likely to venture upon for
himself, and which it will often be impossible to reproduce in a

1 Bp. W. also quotes the Corbey version, ‘res vestrae for ἱμάτια in v. 2, as pointing
to ‘the double sense of the Syriae and Chaldee mans which stands here in the
Peshitto for ‘garment,' but is commonly used for ‘goods' of any kind. ln the
Classical Review v. 68 Ι have adduced a parallel from Rufinus‘ version os Euseb.

res caym-imore solent, which may suggest that this use of res was not more 111100111111011
in the later Latin than the colloquial use of ‘ things' for ‘ clothes' in English.
