clxx THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

The plural of abstract nouns is used to express the various
manifestations of the abstract idea, eg. ii. ]. μὴ ἐν προσωπολημ-
ψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν.

There is a tendency in the Hellenistic writings, notably in the
Apoealypse‚ to put the noun of apposition into the nominative,
even where the original noun is oblique3 thus we have in iii. 8 τὴν
«γλῶσσαν οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται followed by ἀκατάστατον κακόν,
μεστὴ ἰοῦ, which we can here explain as a new sentence with the
subject ἡ «γλῶσσά ἐστιν un(le1·stood; but such an explanation fails
in Apoc. iii. 12 ’γράψω ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς καινῆς Ἰερουσαλήμ,
ἡ καταβαίνουσα ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ καινόν,
and in other passages referred to in my note. We have however
many examples of the ordinary apposition, as in the nom. i. 1
Ἰάκωβος δοῦλος, Ver. S ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος...ιἰνὴρ δίψυχος, ii. 21
’Λβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν, ii. 25 “Ραὰβ ἡ πόρνη, i. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ
αὕτη ἐστίν, ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανούς, where αὕτη is in apposition
to the following infinitive: in the gen. i. 1 Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ,
and the harsh use in ii. 2 τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ
Χριστοῦ, τῆς δόξης, where see note; in the acc. ii. 21 Ἰσαὰκ τὸν
υἱὸν αὐτοῦς not to mention such cases as i. 1 ταῖς δώδεκα φυλαῖς
ταῖς ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ, iii. 6 ἡ «γλῶσσα ἡ σπιλοῦσα, v. 4 ὁ μισθὸς ὁ
ἀφυστερημένος, which are treated of under the article.
