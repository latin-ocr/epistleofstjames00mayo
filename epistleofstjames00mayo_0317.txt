ἔμφυτος, Matt. iV. 4, John Vi. 63 τὰ ῥήματα ἃ ἐγὼ λελάληκα ὑμῖν πνεῦμά
ἐστιν καὶ ζωή ἐστιν, xvii. 7, 8, Rom. X. 17, 1 Pet. i. 23. The phrase
occurs Psa. cxix. 43 (cf. Eccl. xii. 10), Eph. i. 13 ἀκούσαντες τὸν λόγον τῆς
ἀληθείας, τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς σωτηρίας ὑμῶν...ε’σφραγισθητε τῷ πνεύματι,
2 Cor. vi. 7 (approving ourselves as ministers of God) ἐν λόγῳ ἀληθείας,
ἐν δυνάμει θεοῦ, 2 Tim. ii. 15 (Timothy is urged to show himself a
workman rightly dividing) τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας, Col. i. 5 (the hope
which you had) ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου. Alf„ following
Wiesinger‚ calls ἀληθείας a gen. 01 apposition ; why not objective, ‘ the
declaration 01 the truth, viz. of God's love revealed in the life, death,
and resurrection 01 Jesus Ohrist’? cf. below v. 19, and Westcott on
Heb. X. 26.1 See also John viii. 31, 32 ‘if ye continue in my word ye
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you f1·ee,’ and xvii. 17
‘ sanctify them through thy word, thy word is 131111311.1 For the omission
01 the article with abstract words cf. Phil. ii. 16 λόγον ζωῆς ἐπέχοντες,
Gal. V. 5 ἡμεῖς γὰρ πνεύματι ἐκ πίστεως ἐλπίδα δικαιοσύνης ἀπεκδεχόμεθα,
below ver. 22 ποιηταὶ λόγου, iv. 11 νόμον, and see Essay on Grammar
and Winer p. 198 foll. It is quite unnecessary to explain, as
Hofmann, ‘ ein Wort, nicht das Wort.'

εἰς τὸ εἳναι.] Most often used to express the end or aim, as here and
below, iii. 3, Heb. vii. 25, Acts vii. 19, Rom. i. 4 (see Westcott Heb.
p. 342) 3 sometimes the result as in Rom. i. 20 τὰ ἀόρατα αὐτοῦ τοῖς
ποιήμασιν νοούμενα καθορᾶται...εἷς τὸ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἀναπολογήτους, ib. Vii.
4, 5, 2 Cor. vii. 3, viii. 6, Gal. iii. 17, Heb. xi. 33 sometimes merely
reference, as below ver. 19 βραδὺς εἷς τὸ λαλῆσαι ‘2 : see Winer p. 413 foll.

ἀπαρχήν τινα. τῶν αὐτοῦ »cucutia-ww] The gifts Of God were consecrated
by devotion of the First-Fruits3 see D. qf B. S.v., where six kinds,
priva-te or publio, are specified, and cf. Exod xxii. 29 foll„ Deut. xviii.
3, xxvi. 2 1011., Neh. X. 35, Ezek. XX. 40. Similar offerings were
made among the Greeks and Romans, cf. Homeric ἐπάρχομαι, and ἄργ-
ματα, Od. xiv. 446, Herod. i. 92 (01 the offerings 01 Croesus), Thuc.
iii. 58 ὅσα τε ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν ἀνεδίδου ὡραῖα, πάντων ἀπαρχὰς ἐπιφέροντες,
Isaeus Dicaeoy. 42, Lat. primitiae. We find the word used meta-
phorically, Plato Leqy. 767 O„ Plutarch Mor. p. 40, where see Wytt.. 3
SO Philo M. 2. p. 366 (Israel) τοῦ σύμπαντος ἀνθρώπων γένους ἀπενεμήθη
οἷά τις ἀπαρχὴ τῷ ποιητῇ καὶ πατρί, with ref. to Jer. ii. 3. St. Paul
uses it 01 the first converts, Rom. xvi. 5 ὅς ἐστιν ἀπαρχὴ τῆς Ἀσίας εἷς
Χριστόν, 1 Cor. xvi. 15 ἀπ. τῆς 'Axalas-(speaking 01 the house of Stephanas).
The saith 01 the patriarchs, sanctifying their posterity, is typified by the
heave-offering 01 the dough (Numb. xv. 21) εἰ ἡ ἀπαρχὴ ἁγία καὶ τὸ
φύραμα Rom. xi. 16. In 1 Cor. XV. 20 Christ Himself is called ἀπ.
τῶν κεκοιμημένων. The nearest approach to St. James is found in
2 Thess. ii. 13 God has chosen you ἀπαρχὴν εἷς σωτηρίαν z in Rom. viii. 23

1 [I should prefer to take it as a possessive genitive ‘ words belonging ‘co truth,'
as (in 1 Cor. ii. 4, 13) σοφίας λόγοι ‘words belonging to wisdom' or ‘uttered by
wisdom.' A.

² [Out of f0]rty-two Pauline passages I find only one (2 Cor. viii. 6) in which εἰς
τὸ may not be translated ‘in order that'; but often an action is said to have
been done for a purpose contemplated not by the doer but by God, eff. 1 Thess. ii. 16,
Rom. i. 20, iv. 11, &c. A.]
