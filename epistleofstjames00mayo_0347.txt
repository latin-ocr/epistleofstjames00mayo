II 10-12 NOTES 87

vii. 101. We may compare St. Paul (Rom. xiv. 23) πᾶν ὃ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως
ἁμαρτία ἐστίν, and 1 Cor. X. 31 εἴτε οὖν ἐσθίετε εἴτε πίνετε εἴτε τι ποιεῖτε
πάντα Εἷς δυξαν θεοῦ ἸΓΟἰΕῑΤΕ· 1

11. ὁ γὰρ etei-dm] The unity of the law flows fiom the unity of the
law· -giver (below iv. 12)· , it is the 6ΧΡ1 6551011 of 0116 will. The 65561106 of
sin lies 111 disobedience to that Will howevei shown. It was by 611
appeal to the same principle that our Lord answered the question of
the lawyer ποία ἐστὶ πρώτη πασῶν ἐντολή ,· ‘The first of all the com-
mandments is, Hear, O Israel3 the Lord our God is one Lord; and
thou 5116113 10176 13116 Lord thy God' Mark xii. 29. This spiritual view
of the law rendered impossible the comparisons of which the Jews were
so fond.

μὴ μοιχεύσῃς] Η61·6 the seventh eomman dment precedes the sixth, as
in Luke xviii. 20, Rom. xiii. 9, and (LXX) Ex. ΧΧ. where the order is
οὐ μοιχεύσεις,οῧ κλέψεις,οὐ φονεύσεις; cf. Philo M. 2 ,.p 189 η δὲ“ ετέρο.
πεντὰς τὰς πάσας ἀπαγορεύσεις περιέχει μοιχειῶν, φόνου, κλοπ-ῆς, ψευδομαρ-
τυριῶν, επιθυμιῶν, ib. Ρ. 201 ἀπὸ μοιχείας ἄρχεται, ib. 207, 300 ἐν τῇ
δευτερα δέλτα) πρῶτον γράμμα τοῦτ’ εστιν, οὐ μοιχεύσεις. We have the
usual ordei in Deut. v. 17, Matt. v. 21, 27, xix.18; the 01··(161 in Mark
X. 19 vaiies in different MSS. The fuizur’e οὐ μοιχεύσεις 15 used by St.
Matthew, as in the LXX.; μή with the subjunctive by the other
Evangelists, as here.

εἰδὲ, οὐ μοιχεύεις, ῲονεύεις ὃέ.] For οὗ after εἰ See i. 23 οὗ ποιητής n.
Here the more exact way of expression would be μοιχεύεις μὲν οὗ,
φονεύεις δέ, 13116 single word μοιχεύεις being negatived, ‘if you commit
noc adultery, but murder) For the omission of μέν in such antitheses
566 above 17. 2 εἰσέλθῃ δέ and i. 13 πειράζει δέ, 6150 1 Ρ613. 1. 8 ἄρτι μή
ὁρῶντες πιστεύοντες δέ, V. 12 οὐχ ἑαυτοῖς ἡμῖν δέ.

γέγονας παραβάτης νόμον] For perf. see i. 24 3 for παραβάτης above
ver. 9. On omission of article see Essay 011 Grammar.

12. Let your words and acts, e.g. your behaviour to the poor, be
regulated by the thought that you will be judged by a law of freedom
(see 1. 25), that 15, by 6 law of the spirit, not of the lettei. It will be
a deeper- going juclgment than that of man, for it will not stop short
at par²ticula1 precepts or even at the outwar'd act, whatever it may be,
but will penetrate to the temper and inotive. On the other hand it
sweeps away 611 anxious questioning as to the exact performance of each
separate precept. If there 1165 been in you the true spirit of love 130 God
and love to man, that 15 accepted as the real fulfilment of the law. The
same love which actuates the true Christian here actuates the Judge
both here and hei-easter, 01· rather He who is already dwelling in our
11661135 by faith assures us of that forgiveness in our own case which He
enables us to show to others.

οὕτως λαλεῖτε καὶ οὕτως ποιεῖτε] The repetition of οὕτως 15 111 accordance
with the earnest weighty style of the writer: see i. 19 011 βραδύς, and
cf. Buttin. p. 341. It insists on the importance of a right regulation
