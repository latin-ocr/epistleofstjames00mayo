τὲλειοι,] Not ‘ perfect' in the sta-iet sense of the term, since πολλὰ
πταίομεν ἅπαντες (below iii. 2), though all are bidden to aim at perfectiori,
(Matr. v. 4⁸, Eph. iii. 19). 'she word occurs again below iii. 2. It
is used of animals which are full grown (cf. Herod. i. 83, where τὰ
τέλεα τῶν προβάτων are opposed to γαλαθηνά, Thuc. V. 47), and hence in
this :md other passages of Christianis who have attained maturity of
character :und umba-standing (Phil. iii. 15, where see Lightfoot's note,
(jol. i. 28, iv, 12, esp. 1 Gor. xiV. 20, Heb. v. 12-14). Thus it, he-
vomcs almost synonymous with πνευματικός and γνωστικός.1 Philo con-
trasts il: with ἀσκητικός and προκόπτων M. 1. p. 551 τοιαῦτα ὑφηγεῖται τῷ
ἀσκητικῴ ἡ ὑπομονή, 552 τὸν ἀσκητικὸν τρόπον, καὶ νέον παρὰ τὸν τέλειον, καὶ
φιλίας ἄξιον εἶναι τίθεμεν, 169 αἱ τέλειαι ἀρεταὶ μόνου τοῦ τελείου κτήματα,
582, 13⁸9: ef. the Stoic use (stol). Ja'cl. ii. 198> πάντα δὲ τὸν καλὸν καὶ
ἀγαθὸν ἄνδρα τέλειον εἶναι λέγουσι διὰ τὸ μηδεμιᾶς ἀπολείπεσθαι ἀρετῆς.
'l'hc word ἄρτιος is used in the same sense in 2 Tim. iii. 17 ἵνα
ἄρτιος ᾖ ὁ τοῖ’ (θεοῦ ἅνθρωπος πρὸς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἐξηρτισμένος, cf. 1 Pet.
V· 1⁴) ὃ δὲ Θεὸς...ὀλι’γον παθόντας αὐτὸς καταρτίσαι ὑμᾶς. ln Hel). ii· 10

'rho word τέλειος is often used by lator writers of the baptized,
