claim to consideration than (a). A third view (c) which makes the
human spirit the subject seems to 1116 entirely to destroy the meaning
of the passage.

6. μείζονα. δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν] More, 111 consequence of this ι16610115 affec-
tion, which shows itself not in the abandonment of the unfaithful
spouse‚ but in further bounteousness3 cf. 156. liv. 7, 8 ‘for 6 small
moment have 1 forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather tliee,’
1116, ix. 6, 7, on the effect of the Divine ‘jeahiusyf Zech. i. 14, viii. 2,
where the declaration of God's jealousy of Zion is followed by
promises of her future glory. The absolute self-surrender demanded
of the Christian is rewarded by richer supplies of divine grace than he
could otherwise receive. For the pregnant 1156 of μείζων cf. above iii. 1.

διὸ λέγει.] The subject understood is probably God, as above i. 12
ἐπηγγείλατο, and Eph. iv, 8,17. 14, where the same phrase oceiu‘s ; others
take it as ἡ γραφή, cf. above ver. 5.

ὁ Θεὸς ὑπερηῴἀνοις ἀντιτάσσεται ταπεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν.] Cited in the
same form 1 Pet. 17. 5. The LXX. (Prov. iii. 34) has Κύριος for Θεός.
Clement of Rome (I. 30), who also has Θεός, has probably borrowed the
quotation from St. J ames, as his next sentence reminds us of our epistle‚
καταλαλιᾶς πόρρω ἑαυτοὺς ποιοῦντες, ἔργοις δικαιούμενοι καὶ οὐ λόγοις. For
ἀντιτ. ‘ sets himself against ' see Acts xviii. 6, Rom. xiii. 2. For
ὑπερηφ. ‘ conspicuous beyond others‚' ‘ outshining then]‚' and so ‘ proud,'
‘ hauglity‚' 1 see Sirim. X. 7 μισητὴ ἔναντι Κυρίου καὶ ἀνθρώπων ὑπερηφανία,
ib. V. 12 ἀρχὴ ὑπερηφανίας ἀνθρώπου ἀφισταμένου ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου,
καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτὸν ἀπέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, 17. 18 οὐκ ἔκτισται
ἀνθρώποις ὑπερηφανία, Psalm. Sol. ii. 25, iv. 28, where it is used of
defiant wickedness. In St. Peter the quotation simply enforces
an exhortation to humility, ‘ be humble, for grace follows⁷ : here
we have to suppose ὑπερηφανία (⁶ pride of life,’ 1 John i. 16)
identified with ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου 111 v. 4 3 see the passage just
quoted from Sirac. X. 12. Τ116 friend of the world is proud because
he makes himself his own centre, disowning his dependence upon God,
see Trench Syn. p. 113 foll„ Cheyne on Isaiah ii. 12.

7. ὑποτάγητε] Α favourite word with St. Peter.

ἀντίστητε δὲ τῷ ὃιαβόλῳ.] Opposed first to the previous clause, and
then the addition of καὶ φεύξεται suggests a new contrast to the clause
which follows. Compare the parallel passage in 1 Pet. v. 8, 9, also Eph.
vi. 11, 12. Τ116 devil is the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου (above ver. 4, John
xiv. 30), 116 inspires hatred and discord (above iii. 15, John viii. 44), the
proud fall into his condemnation (above ver. 6, 1 Tim. iii. 6).

καὶ φεύξεται ἀφ’ ὑμῶν.] The imperative followed by καὶ 15 an energefie
form of the conditional sentence, see A. Buttmann, p. 196, and compare
John ii. 19 λύσατε τὸν ναὸν καὶ ἐγερῶ αὐτόν, also below vv. 8, 10. The
promise gives an answer to those who might plead in excuse the power
of the tempter, as others pleaded the force of circumstances ordained
by God (above i. 13). Christ’s temptation is an example of submission
to God’s appointment‚ followed by the ssight of the devil. We find 6

¹ It seems to be derived from the adjectival form ὕπερος and φαίνω likc ἐλαφηβόλος
from ἔλαφος and βάλλω.
