xl TIIE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

elsewhere cannot 136 owing to ignorance, for a sect which had been
singled out for years before he wrote, as a mark for imperial
vcugeance at Rome, must have been only too well known in
Judaea. On 1116 011161 hand, if the passage had been a Christian
interpolation, the notice os James would have been more lauda-
tory, as is actually the case in the spurious addition read by Origen
and Eusebius.' Of Hegesippus he says: ‘His account presents
some striking resemblances with the portion of the Clementine
Recognitions conjectured to be taken from the Ebionite Ἀναβαθ-
μοὶ Ἰακώβου (so called as describing the ascents of James up the
temple stairs, whence he harangued the people); and we may
hazard the conjecture that the story of the martyrdom, to which
Hegesippus is imlcbted, was the grand finale of these “Ascentsf’
The Recognitions record how Jaines refutcd the Jewish sccts;
Hegesippus makes the conversion of certain of these sects 1116
starting-point of the persecution which led to his martyrdom. In
the Recognitions he is thrown down the flight of steps and left as
dead by his persecutors, but is taken up alive by the brethrcn: in
Hegesippus he is hurled from the still lostier station, and this time
his death is made sure.' ‘There is much in the account which
cannot be true: the assigning to him a privilege which was con-
fined to the high priest alone is plainly false3 such an imagination
could only have arisen in a generation which knew nothing of the
temple services. Moreover the account of his testimony ancl death
not only contradicts the brief contemporary notice of J osephus, but
is so fullos high improbabilities that it must throw discredit on
the whole context. Still it is possible that J aines may have been
a Nazarite, may have been a strict ascetic.' Perhaps it may seem
even more incredible that the Jews could have been in doubt as to
the belief of him who had been the most prominent member of the
Church at Jerusalem for twenty years or more, or could have
imagined that one of such firm, unbending character, the very

opposite of a Cranmer, could be induced to deny his saith before
the people.
