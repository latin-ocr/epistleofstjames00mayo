1116 control of human nature. 11, is also vngues than πάντα τα θηρία
and may be supposed 10 adluit, of individual exceptions.

(Solomon) ἐλάλησε περὶ τῶν κτηνῶν καὶ περὶ. των πετεινῶν καὶ περι των
ἑρπετῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν ἰχθύων. So Philo M. ..p 352 foll. divides ζῶα
into τετράποδα, ἔνυδρα, ἑρπετὰ, πτηνά. The word θηρία has· ‘t wider 01
narrower meaning: 11 may even include bees, fishes, and worms (see
exx. in lex), 01· may be confined 10 quadrupeds or more strictly 1ο wild
beasts, which is of course 1116 prominent idea here, as there is no need
10 insist on the fact, that domestic beasts are tamed. In like manner
ἑρπετά 16 used 111 a wider sense for animals, which walk on four or inore
legs in contradistinction 10 man who walks on two, as in Xen. Mem. i.
4. 11 and 1116 poebs 3 bub also for 1116 very unseientific class of reptiles,
mcluding 1116 weasel, 1116 11101166, 1116 lizard, 1116 grasshopper (LeV. xi.
21, 29). The word ἐνάλιος is 1101 found elsewhere in 1116 1311316, but 11 is
quite classical (cf. Soph. Ant. 345 πόντου τ’ εἰναλίαν φύσιν), and is used,
as here, with substantival force by Plut. Mor. 669 τὸ τῶν ἐναλίων γένος,
ib. 729, cf. ps. Arist. Mund. 5 ἐναλίων ζώων καὶ πεζῶν καὶ ἀερίων φύσεις
ἐχώρισε. For 1116 coupling of the words in 1116 1161 by τε and καὶ 60111-
pare Rom. i. 14 ’Έλλησί τε καὶ βαρβάροις, σοφοῖς τε καὶ ἀνοήτοις.
Probably beasts and birds are coupled as 1116 nobler orders, and 1116
other two because some of 1116 ἑρπετὰ are amphibious, and others, as
snakes, closely lesemble some fishes.
