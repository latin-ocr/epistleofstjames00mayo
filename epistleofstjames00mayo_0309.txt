Herod. ii. 70 ἐπεὰν νῶτον ὑὸς δελεάσῃ περὶ ἄγκιστρον. . ,ὁ κροκόδειλος ἐντυχὼν
τῷ νώτῳ καταπίνει, οἶδὲ ἕλκουσιν· ἐπεὰν δὲ ἐξελκυσθῇ ἐς γῆν κ.τ.λ. This
would make a ὕστερον πρότερον in our text, where the drawing is
previous to the actual catching at the particular bait. Heisen cites a
number of lines of Oppian in which ἕλκω and its compounds are used,
as here, of the first drawing of the fish out from its original retreat, eg.
iii. 316 the bait ἐφέλκεται ἰχθύας εἴσω, iv. 3593 cf. Xen. Cyrop. viii.
l. 32 ἐγκράτειαν οὕτω μάλιστ’ ἂν ᾤετο ἀσκεῖσθαι εἰ αὐτὸς ἐπιδεικνύοι ἑαυτὸν
μὴ ὑπὸ τῶν παραυτίκα ἡδονῶν ἑλκόμενον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγαθῶν, ib. fllem. iii. 11. 18.
In like manner the first effect of ἐπιθυμία is to draw the man out of
his original repose, the second to allure him to a definite bait. Heisen
illustrates this from the temptation of Eve, first moved from hei·
secure trust in God by the words of the tempter (Gen. iii. 1—5)‚ then
attracted by the fruit itself (v. 6).1 Another way of distinguishing
between the two words is to suppose that ἐξέλκω implies the violence,
δελ. the charm of passion, as in Philo M. 2, p. 470 πρὸς ἐπιθυμίας
ἐλαύνεται ἢ ὑφ’ ἡδονῆς δελεάζεται, ‘driven by passion or solicited by
pleasure,' but I prefer the former explanation.

15, συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει &pap-riam] For the metapllor cf. PSa. vii. 14
ὦδίνησεν ἀδικίαν, συνέλαβε πόνον καὶ ἔτεκεν ἀνομίαν, Philo Μ. 1. 40 οἷα
ἐταιρὶς καὶ μάχλος οῧσα ἡδονὴ γλίχεται τυχεῖν ἐραστοῦ, ib. 149 ὅταν ὃ ἐν ἡμῖν
νοῦς-κεκλήσθω δὲ Ἀδάμ-ἐντυχὼν αἰσθήσει-*καλεῖται δὲ Εὕα-συνουσίας
ὀρεχθεὶς πλησιάσῃ, ἥδε συλλαμβάνει...ἐγκῦμων τε γίνεται καὶ εὐθυς ὠὸίιιει
καὶ τίκτει κακῶν ψυχῆς τὸ μέγιστον, οἴησιν, ib. 183 ὥσπερ ταῖς γυναιξὶ πρὸς
ζώων γένεσιν οἰκειότατον μέρος ἡ φύσις ἔδωκε μήτραν, οὕτω πρὸς γένεσιν
πραγμάτων ὥρισεν ἐν ψυχῇ δύναμιν, δι’ ἧς κυοφορεῖ καὶ ὠδίνει καὶ ἀποτίκτει
πολλὰ διάνοια· τῶν δὲ ἀποκυομένων νοημάτων τὰ μὲν ἄρρενα, τὰ δὲ θηλέα,
J nstin M. Trypho 327 C παρθένος οὖσα Εὕα τὸν λόγον τὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄφεος
συλλαβοῦσα παρακοὴν καὶ θάνατον ἔτεκε, and in Classical writers Theognis
153 τίκτει γὰρ κόρος ὕβριν, and Aesch. Ay. 727 foll. Sin is the result of
the surrender of the will to the soliciting of ἐπιθυμία instead of the
guidance of reason. In itself, ἐπιθυμία may be natural and innocent:
it is when the man resolves to gratify it against what he feels to be
the higher law of duty, that he becomes guilty of sin even before he
carries out his resolve in act.

ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία. ἀποτελεσθεῖσα ἀποκυεῖ θάνατον,] ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία takes up the
preceding ἁμαρτίαν as ἡ δὲ ὖπομονή takes up ὑπομονήν in V. 4. Sin When
full-grown, when it has become a fixed habit determining the character
Of the man, brings forth death. Cf. below ii. 22 ἐκ τῶν ἔργων ἡ πίστις
ἐτελειώθη, and τέλειος above v, 4, Philo M. 1. p. 94 τῆς κακίας ἡ μὲν ἐν
σχέσει ἡ δὲ ἐν κινήσει θεωρεῖται· νεύει δὲ πρὸς τὰς τῶν ἀποτελεσμάτων

¹ The two examples cited for this use of ἐξέλκειν by one commentator after another
are somewhat doubtful. Arist. Pol. V. 10. 1311, b. 30 παρὰ τῆς γυναικὸς ἐξελκυσθείς
might mean ‘lured away from the side of his wife‚' but hardly ab ¹uasorc sollicitatas
(Alf.) ; and that which Alford calls ‘the nearest correspondence of all, Plut. de scm
numinis vindicta τὸ ’γλυκὺ τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ὥσπερ δέλεαρ ἐξέλκειν,’ I have searched for
in vain in the treatise referred to, and it is not to be found in wyttenbach's Index.
It is, I presume, a misquotation for the words which do occur in that treatise (p. 554
E) ἔχεται ἕκαστος ἀδικήσας τῇ δίκῃ, καὶ τὸ γλυκὺ τῆς ἀδικίας ὥσπερ δέλεαρ εὐθὺς ἐξεδή-
δοκε, τὸ δὲ συνειδὸς ἐγκείμενον ἔχων κ.τ.λ.
