182 COMMENT

At first the impulse is a blind instinctive movement, involuntary
md therefore innocent, but if unchecked it discovers a definite
>iim, which it sceks to attain by uniting itself with thought and
will. Sin originates when we choose to dwell upon the thought
af the pleasure suggested, though knowing, or strongly suspecting,
{hat it cannot be lawfully obtained. The desire becomes strengel·
by indulgence, the thought of sin ceases to shock as it becomes more
familiar, until at last that which had been long rchearsed in the
imagination is enacted in real life. In most cases the coinmission of
the outward act is followed by something os shame or remorse, which
may lead to genuine repentame, but if the sting of conscience is ‹lis-
regarded, the first wrong action is naturally followed by others, which
give rise to a sinful habit, and at length conscience is silenced‚ the will
is permanently enshwed, the moral nature is to all appearance dead 3
and so the soul departs to the other world to receive the reward of the
things done in the body. The genesis of temptation is admirably
illustrated in the story of Macheth. In the second scene we have the
picture of an innocent and laudable ambition. The interview with the
witches shows this ambition perilously sensitive to outward solicitation‚
and already open to the suggestion of unlawful means for the attain-
ment of the coveted object, a suggestion seconded by his wife's direct
instigation‚ and supported by external circumstances, the nomination
of Malcolm as heir to the throne and the visit of Duncan. We have
then after many misgivings the final resolve and the execution of the
murder: the consequent change from the noble Macbeth, whose nature
is full of the milk of human kindness and of whom it is said ‘what
thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily,¹ to the bloodthirsty
tyrant of the later soenes. It is to be noticed that in Macheth we are
always conscious of a background of hellish instigation. This does not
appear in the first chapter of St. -James, but is recognized afterwards
in iii. 6 where the tongue is said to be set on firc of hell, iii. 15 where
false wisdom is described as devssish, iv. 7 where we are bidden to
submit oui-selves to God and resist the devil, ‘the tempter’ as he is
called by St. Paul, who makes use of our natural impulses to bring us
to ruin.

Here however a further difficulty arises, for the act-ion of Satan is
sometimes said to be permitted by God, as in the temptation of Job3
at other times an action is attributed indifferently to Satan and to
God, as in the numbering of the people by David, which is said to bc
instigated by God in 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, by Satan in l Chron. xxi. 1 ; and
yet again (lod seems to be refu-esented as the author of innnoral or
irreligious conduct in inan, as in Ex. ix. 115 ‘the Lord hardened the
beart of Pharaoh.’ With regard to thc first case the answer is simple:
Satan tempts with the design of inducing dob to give up his righteous-
ness and his trust in uod: God permits the temptation, because he
knows the end will be to prove Job's faith and confirm his righteous-
ness. It is fundamentally the case of those to whom Str. James writes.
They are in trouble3 Satan is allowed to suggest that this trouble is a
sign that God neglects them3 yet they are to rejoice in this trouble
