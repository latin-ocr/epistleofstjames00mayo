V 14 NOTES 159

Chris-t would come καὶ ἀλείψει αὐτὸν τῷ τοιούτῳ ἐλαίῳ καὶ ἀναστήσεται...
καὶ τότε ἀπὸ πάσης νόσου ἰαθήσεται. irenaeus (i. 21. 5, Cf. August.
Haeres. 16, Epiphan. llaeres. xxx. 2) says that the Gnostic sect 01 1116
Heracleonites anointed the dying with 011 and water to protect them
from hostile spirits in the other world. Chrysostmn, Hom. 3 in illast.
(Migne I'cttrol. Gr. vol. 57, col. 384), magnifying the sanctity 01 Ohurch
vessels generally, says, those know how far our lamps sui-pass all others
ὅσοι μετὰ πίστεως καὶ εὐκαίρως ἐλαίῳ χρισάμενοι νοσήματα ἔλυσαν, from
which it is infel-red that the 011 101· ancinting the sick was taken from
the lamps used in church, as is still the custom in the Greek Ohurch, cf.
Neale's Easfern Clam-cla, Introd. pp. 966, 1037, Dict. of Chr. Aut. under
‘Oil' p. 1453 foll. Cassianus speaking 01 Α111101 Paul says (Goll. vii. 26)
such virtue proceeded from him, that eum (le oleo quod corpore con-
cesssyisset unquerentm· ilfiq'mi, confestim cunctis valetudinibus cumo-entur.
This may be compared with Chrys. [[οηι. in Alart. (Patr. vol. 50. col.
6⁴34), where he recommends, as a remedy against drunkenness, the
anointing 01 1116 body with oil taken from the martyrs' tombs. So the
Nestorians mix 011, water and the relies 01 some saint or, 11 these 61·6
not to be procured, dust from the scene of 6 inartyrdom, and 6601111
1116 sick with it (Neale, bc. p. 1036 and cf. Greg. T. Mir. Allart. i. 2).
On the Oil of the Cross see Dz’et. Cleo: Ant. Le.

From these facts it may be probably inferred that, 1116 ancinting
with simple 011 having ceased to be effective in healing the sick, some
endeavoured to add fresh virtue to the 011 6111161· by special consecra-
tion or by combining it with the relies of saints, while others, like 1116
followers 01 Heracleon and the Ohurch 01 Rome in later times, sup>
posed it 10 retain 6 purely spiritual efficacy, thus changing a hypo-
thetical appendage to the injunction (κᾶν ἁμαρτίας ᾖ πεποιηκώς) into the
65561166 of the injunction itself. There is, I believe, no recorded
instance during the first eight centuries of 1116 ancinting 01 1116 sick
being deferred, as having only 6 spiritual efficacy, to the point 01
death, except among the Heracleonites, whose conception 01 1116 use
01 the anoiuting, 65 described by Epiphanius Ze, is almost in verbal
agreement with the language of 6 monastic rule for Extreme Unction
contained in Mai-tene <De Antiquis Ecclesiae lfistbus, vol. 5 p. 241)
ut more militis uncti praeparatus cccl certamen aereas possit superare
potestates.

Many stories are told of cures wrought by the Unction 101· 1116 Sick
16 D. of Christian Ant. pp. 1455 and 2004. In the Greek Ohurch the
011, called εὐχέλαιον, 15 usually consecrated by seven priests. In the
West we find the 011 consecrated by laymen and even by women as late
as 1116 6111 century. In the 8111 century Boniface ordered 611 pres-
byters to obtain the 011 01 1116 sick from the bishop. It is curicus that
in the early church it was not necessary for the anointing to be
done by a priest: it was frequently performed by the sick man
or by his friends.1 It is not till A.D. 852 that the function 01
anointing is confined to the priest. The original intention for the

¹ Caesarius of Arles (502 A.D.) during an epidrmie recommends a person to anoint
both himself aud family with blcssed 011 (Scrm. 89. 5).
