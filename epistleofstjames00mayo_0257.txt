THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES ccxxxi

THE OATHO LIC EPISTLES.

THOUGH the word καθολική does not form part of the Title 01
1116 Epistle of St. -Jaines in any of the older MSS, yet the fact
that this Epistle was included from an early period 111 1116 collec-
tion known as the Catholic Epistles‚ which followed the Acts and
preceded the Epistles of St. Paul, seems to call for a short note on
the history and meaning of the term.

Eusebius is the first to mention the fact in the words τοιαῦτα
τὰ κατὰ τὸν Ἰάκωβον, οὗ ἡ πρώτη τῶν ὀνομαζομένων καθολικῶν
ἐπιστολῶν εἶναι λένγεται (HE. ii. 23), and We find the same
asserted in the Catalogues of the Canonical Books ratified by the
Councils of Laodicea and of Carthage, as well as in the lists given
by Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, and Am-
philochius before the end of the fourth century.1 Earlier uses of
the term may be found in Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iv. 15,
p. 605 P), where, in speaking of the Epistle put forth by the
Apostolic Council recorded in Acts xv„ he says κατὰ τὴν ἐπιστο-
λὴν τὴν καθολικὴν τῶν ἀποστόλων ἁπάντων ; and in Origen, with
reference to the Epistle of Barnabas (ο. Cels. i. 63) «γέγραπται ἐν
τῇ Βαρνάβα καθολικῇ ἐπιστολῇ, as well as to the Epistles of St.
John, St. Peter, and St. Jude.'Z Apollonius (0. 210 ΑΒ.) reproached
Themison the Montanist with writing a catholic epistle in imita-
tion of the Apostle (St. John).3

The meaning of the term is thus stated by Oecumenius in his
Preface 10 0111 Epistle: καθολικαὶ λένγονται αὗται οἱονεὶ ε”γκύκ-
λιοι· οὐ Γγὰρ ἀφωρισμένως ἔθνει ἑνὶ ἢ πόλει, ὡς ὁ θεῖος Παῦλος
τοῖς (Ρωμαιόις ἢ Κορινθίοις προσφωνεῖ ταύτας τὰς ἐπιστολὰς ὁ
τῶν τοιούτων τοῦ Κυρίου μαθητῶν θίασος, ἀλλὰ καθόλου τοῖς
πιστοῖς ἤτοι Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ, ὡς καὶ ὁ Πέτρος, ἢ
καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ὑπὸ τὴν αὐτὴν πίστιν Χριστιανοῖς τελοῦσιν. Thus
understood, the term is not properly applicable to the 21111 and
