forbidding marriage among their adherents. Of the latter, evidence
may be found in Athenagoras Apol. 28 εὕροις δ’ ἂν πολλοὺς τῶν

ἐλπίδι τοῦ μᾶλλον συνέσεσθαι τῷ Θεῴ; in such language as that
of Cypri-an (Hal). Vir. 3) flos est ille ecclesiastici yerttzinis. ..Dei

act by which Origen, at the beginning of the third century, believed
himself to be carrying out the words of Christ (Matt. xix. 12). The
same tendency is also noticeable in the neo-Pythagoreans and neo-
Platonists. By the end of the third century it began to produce
its natural consequence in the institution of celibate communit-ies
and the discouragement of marriage among the clergy. In the
Council of Nicaea a determined attempt was made to compel
married clergy to separate from their wives, and the hermit Paph-
nutius, who led the opposition, only pleaded in favour of what he
calls the ancient custom, which, while it forbade marriage after a
man had been ordained, did not require him to leave the wife whom
he had married as a layman.l YVe cannot doubt that those who
were agitating for a stricter rule would make use of the example of
the Virgin, insistiug on the name as implying a permanent state,
and would endeavour to give an artificial strength to their cause
by the addition of imaginary circumstances to the simple narrative
of the Gospel.
Thus it was not enough to suppose the brethren of the Lord to be The story οἱ

sons of Joseph by a former wife; Joseph's age must be increased fflgffffissff

so as to make it impossible for him to have had children by his ,1335ng f
second wife, though this supposition contradicts what the upholders Iihe ἃβςὲῑῑῠ
of this view maintain to be the very purpose of Mary's marriage, Spm'
viz. to screen her from all injurious imputations. How could the
marriage effect this, if the husband were above eighty years of

age, as Epiphanius says, following the Apocryphal Gospels? Again,

if this were the case, why should not the Evangelist have stated it

simply, instead of using the cautionary phrases πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν

and οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἕως οὗ ἔτεκεν.) But even this was not ῃ
enough for the ascetic spirit. Further barriers must be raised

between the conta-mination of matrimony and the virgin ideal.
