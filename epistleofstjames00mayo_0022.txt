CHAPTER VI

PERSONS TO WHOM THE EPISTLE Is ADDRESSED AND PLACE FROM WHICH
1'1} Is WRITTEN

The various Dispersions of Israel, p. cx. This Epistle was probably addressed
to the Eastern Dinspora, p. cxii. What may be inferred from the Epistle
as to the character and condition of the readers, p. cxiii. It contains no
allusion to Gentiles ; the rich oppressors are unbelieving Jews, p. cxiv.
The faults noted are the same as those laid to the charge of the tJews in
the Epistles of St. Paul and St. Peter, p. cxvi. The allusions are in
accordance with the supposition tlxat it was written from Jerusalem to

Jews, p. cxvii.
CHAPTER VH
ΘΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE

The general result of the externa] and internal evidence points to the fifth
decade after Christ as the time of composition, p. cxix. This date is
confirmed by the absence of any reference to the fall of Jerusalem, or to
the admission of Gentiles into the Church, p. cxx. Tlie allusions to
Church order and discipline, and the J udaie tone, are in accordance with
an early date, p. cxxi. On the other hand it was written aster a per-
secution, St. J aines had attained a position of authority, and the persons
addressed were no longer recent converts, p. cxxiii. Grounds on which
it has been ascribed to a later date: the use of the name ‘Christ’ without
the article, condition of the Churches addresaed, waning belief in the
Second Cmning, p. cxxv. Examination of Dr. Davidson's argument
proving that it ‘was written by an anonymous Ebionite shortly before the
fall of Jerusalem, p. cxxviii. Examination of von Soden's argument
proving that it was written in the time of Domitian, p. cxxx. Examina-
tion of W. Briickner’s argument proving that it was foxged by an Essene
living at Rome aster 150 Ast, p. cxxxv, Examination of Pfleiderer’s argu-
