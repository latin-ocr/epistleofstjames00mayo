ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxvii

are we to dispute St. James's right to use it, as if it could only be
ascribed to an unintelligent repetition of St. Peter's language ἲ If
Bruckner had paid a little more attention to our Epistle he would
have seen that one of its most marked characteristics is tho
commencement of each paragraph by a statement of the practical
maxim, usually a precept or an interrogation, which it is intended
to enforce3 eg. i. 19 contains the maxim, ‘Let each be swift to hear,
slow to speak‚ and slow to wrath‚' which is explained and illus-
trated in vv. 20-273 the injunction against respect of persons in
ii. 1 is explained and illustrated in vv. 2—10 3 the maxim that
saith without works is valueless in ii. 14 is explained and illus-
trated in vv. 15—26, &e Again, it is true that there is no refer-
ence in our Epistle to persecutions from the heathen 3 but , if thc
readers are liable to be dragged before the Jewish courts on a
charge of Christianity by their unbelieving countrymen (ii. 6, 7) 3
if they are oppressed by their rich neighbours‚ who withhold their
wages and threaten their life (V. 4—6> ; it is surely a little absurd
to deny that they are ἐν ποικίλοις πειρασμοῖς. It is true again
that the devil is not referred to as the cause of these outward
πειρασμοί, but rather as the god of this world, the inspirer of a

false wisdom, the instigator of all the evil wrought by means of

the tongue (iv. 4—7, iii. 6, 15); which some may perhaps
consider to be both a deeper and a wider conception of diabolic
activity than that in the parallel passage of St. Peter.

Briickner next compares ,J ames i. 18, 21 with 1 Pet. i. 23,ὓ ii. 1. The
general conception in both is the same, that Christians are born again through
the instrumentality of the Word of God3 and the practica] inference the
same, to cast away all that might hinder the reception of the Word ; but while
all is natural and straightforward in Peter, J ames shows that he copies with-
out understanding, by his use of the term ἔμφυτον. 111 ver. 18 he had said
that God ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λόγῳ ἀληθείας, 111 ver. 21 he says δέξασθε τὸν
ἔμφυτον λόγον, but how can we receive what has been already engrafted ’ἐ

This is a criticism founded simply on a misapprehension of the
meaning of a term, as to which see my note in loco and also (for
the force of these verbals in -τος) 011 ἀπείραστος i. 13.

The next point raised is, that 111 1 Pet. v. 1-11 there is a better logical (3) the

connexion than 111 the parallel passage James iv. 6—10, and that the former is
therefore the original. The general drift in Peter is as follows:—(vv.
1-4) the elders are admonished to take charge of the flock of Christ, not
as having dominion over them, but as setting them an example ε by so doing
they will receive from the chief Shepherd, on his appearing, the crown of
glory which sadeth not away: (vv, 5-7) the admonition is extended to

admoniti on
to resist the

devil,
