II 16-19 ΝΟΤΕ8 93

future dicet aliquis is far more common tha-n the present subjunctive,
see Roby, vol. ii. pref. p. 101 foll.

κάγὼ] 111 the N.T. the contr-acted is more usual than the 1111001κ
tracted form, see WH. app. p. 145, NViner p. 51. We also find κάμοί,
κάμέ, κάκεῖ, κάκεῖνος. Α close parallel to the form of this sentence is
found in Theoph. Ααύοἶ. 1. 2 δεῖξόν μοι τὸν ἄνθρωπόν σου, κάγώ σοι δείξω
τὸν Θεόν μου.

χωρὶς τῶν ἕργων.] We must supply ο-ου just as we supply μου after
’τῆν πίστιν. Cf. Rom. iii. 28 λογιζόμεθα δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς
ἔργων νόμου, ib. iv. 6 ὁ Θεὸς λογίζεται δικαιοσύνην χωρὶς ἔργων.

ἐκ τῶν ἔργων] So V. 21 below and 111. 13 ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς.

19. σὺ πιστεύεις ὅτι εἷς ἐστιν ὁ Θεός.] This reading supported by A.
Sin. Pesh. &c seems preferable to that of B (accepted by WH.) εἷς Θεός
ἐστιν, as it expresses a 111010 definite belief in the actual formula
of Jewis 11 orthodoxyg niv en in Ι)0111;.11.4 ἄκουε Ἰσραήλ, Κ1’ριος ο Θεος

‘For him who reads the Shema With scrupulous precision as regards its
several letters, they cool Gehinnom' (Berakoth 156, quoted in Taylor,
Jewisla Fadaers, p. 52, and exc. iw). St. Paul depicts the reliance
placed by the Jews on their orthodoxy‚ Rom. ii. 17—22. The phrase
πιστ. ὅτι denotes intellectual belief, as contrasted with πιστ. εἰς or ἐν
denoting moral faith or trust3 so Bede: aliud est credere illi, aliud
credere illum, aliud credere in illum. Credere illi, est credere *cera
esse quae loquitur ‚· credere illum, credere quod ipse sit Deus ;
credere in illum est 0ἰὶἰὶῃονο illum. Credere vera esse quae loquitur
multi et ‘mali possunt ,· credunt enim esse vera et nolunt ea facere, quia
ad operandum pigyri sunt. Credere autem ipsum esse Deum, hoc ec
demones potuerunt. Credere vero in Deum soli novere qui (liligsunt Deum,
qui non solo nomine sunt Christiani, secl et sactis ec vitm· quia sine
dilectione fides inanis. WH. take the clause interrogatively : it seems
to me more impressive to regard it as stating a simple matter of fact,
like σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις before. There is no need to suppose with Winer
(p. 678) that it expresses a condition, to which καλῶς ποιεῖς supplies the
apodosis 3 what is prepared for 15 the following phrase καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια
κ.τ.λ., not the merely parenthetic καλῶς ποιεῖς. Another question is
whether St. J ames must be supposed to speak here in his own person,
or whether this verse also must be assigned to the interlocutor intro-
duced in V. 18. The repetition Of σὺ πιστεύεις aster σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις and
the decided break before V. 20 seem to favour the latter view, We
must suppose him thus to put forward the two arguments (1) belief
without works (may possibly be a real belief, but) can never prove its
existence3 (2) it may exist, and yet be consistent with diabolic
malignity.
