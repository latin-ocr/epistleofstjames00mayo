Gon THE AUTHOR or ALL Goon.

To dissipate entirely the idea that temptation 0011105 from God, and
that man is therefore not responsible for his sin, 81. James here gives
the positive side of that characteristic which he had shadowed out 011
its negative side in ver. 13. God is not merely Himself free from all
touch of evil, and therefore incapable of injuring others, He is absolute
Goodness, always coininunicating good to others, and Hiinself the
hidden spring of all good (lone by others. Nor is it only moral good
that comes from Him, though that may be His most perfect gift 3 but
all light, all truth, beauty and happiness, all that at first made thc
world appear good in the eyes of its Creator, is still His work, His gift.
It is vain to look for good from any other quarter‚ from the lusts of
the flesh, or the smiles of the world. Man, however, by his own sin
raises up a cloud which hides from him the face of God3 and thus 110
0011105 10 picture to himself a God who is no longer loving, but stern,
vindictive, jealous of human happiness. Such an imagination is 0
delusion of the devil. Even this material sun does not cease to shine
behind the cloud which hides it from human view 3 and God's
love, more unchanging than the brightness of the sun, kuows no
eclipse. In all worlds He is eternally the same, the giver of all good,
who cannot do otherwise than will what is best for every one of His
creatures. His purpose for us Christians is that we should be the
first—fruits‚ the sample and earnest, of His new creation. Through us
He reveals to the world what He would have all men to be. And the
means by which He renews in us the divine image, which is the true
nature of man, is the declaration of His love, made first through the
Son, and then further explained and enforced by those whom the Son
has sent to sow the good seed of the kingdom. The teaching of Christ
rightly received into the heart constitutes the germ of a new divine
life, by which it is the will of God that humanity as a whole should
in the end be permeated and transfused.1

It shows how liable men are to be deluded by phrases, that Luther,
with this passage before him, could imagine the teaching of 81, J ames
to be opposed to that of 81. Paul. ‘ By grace are ye saved through
saith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God' is not a stronger
