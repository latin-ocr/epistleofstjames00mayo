different nature between Clopas and our Lord. His testimony, tlelffieffiisshqft

preserved by Eusebius (H. Ε. iv, 22), is to the effect that ‘after the elopas was

martyrdom of J ames the Just on the same charge as the Lord, his Jss'srss'ssiifriiis

paternal uncle's child Symeon, the son of Clopas, is next made δῗῖιὶεδέζὲἕζᾎ
bishop‚ who was put forward by all as the second in successim, Jisslixllv‘iqlieili,

being cousin of the Lord ' (μετὰ τὸ μαρτυρῆσαι Ἰάκωβον τὸν δίκαιον elaissilllerilot

ὡς καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐπὶ τῷ αὐτῷ λόγῳ, πάλιν ὁ ἐκ τοῦ θείου αὐτοῦ lilffilfflstiffs
Συμεὼν ὁ τοῦ Κλωπᾶ καθίσταται ἐπίσκοπος, ὃν προέθεντο πάντες
ὄντα ἀνεψιὸν τοῦ Κυρίου δεύτερον). Some have understood this to
mean that Symeon and J ames were both sons of the Lord's reputed
uncle Clopas, and thus that Symeon was the second of his cousins
who was bishop of Jerusalem. But Bp. Lightfoot well remarks
that, if this were meant, we must have had ἕτερος τῶν ἐκ τοῦ
θείου, not ὁ ἐκ τοῦ θείου, and that it would have been far more
natural simply to have said ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ. The meaning of
δεύτερον 13 made clear from Euseb. H. Ε. iii. :22 τῶν ἐπ’ Ἀντιο-
χείας Εὐοδίου πρώτου καταστάντος, δεύτερος ἐν τοῖς δηλουμένοις
Ἰγνάτιος ἐγνωρίζετο. Συμεὼν ὁμοίως δεύτερος μετὰ τὸν τοῦ Σωτῆ-
ρος ἡμῶν ἀδελφὸν τῆς ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐκκλησίας κατὰ τούτους
τὴν λειτουργίαν ἐγκεχειρισμένος ἣν, ib. iii. 32 ἐν ᾧ (διωγμῷ) Συμε-
ῶνα τὸν τοῦ Κλωπᾶ, ὃν δεύτερον καταστῆναι τῆς ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις
ἐκκλησίας ἐπίσκοπον ἐδηλώσαμεν, μαρτυρίῳ τὸν βίον ἀναλῦσαι
παρειλήφαμεν. These passages are also important as showing that,
while the son of Clopas is described as the cousin of J esus, J ames
is still described as his brother: so too Jude (ih. iii. 20). The
relationship is more exactly defined in the llth ch. of the same
book, where it is said that after the death of J ames the surviving
apostles and disciples of the Lord unanimously elected Symeon as
his successor, ἀνεψιόν, ὥς γε φασί, γεγονότα τοῦ Σωτῆρος· τὸν γὰρ
οὖν Κλωπᾶν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ Ἰωσὴφ ὑπάρχειν εΗγήσιππος ἱστορεῖ.
If Clopas is really the same as Alphaeus‚ this Symeon would be
brother of the Apostles J ames the Little and Matfflew, as well as of
the J oses mentioned in Mark xv. 40 :'but few would contend that
these nephews of the reputed father of J esus could really be known
as ‘ the Lord's brethren.'
