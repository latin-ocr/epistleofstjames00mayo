cxl THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

acquaintance with our Epistle, he would naturally employ it of a
matter of more general importance.

Ina later chapter 01 the same volume Briickner deals with the Epistles
which he assigns to the second century as having been written after the lst e istle
of Peter. These are the second to the Thessalonians, and those to the olos-
siansand Ephesiam, belonging to the earlier half of the century ; and secondly,
the Pastoral Epistles, J ames, Jude, 1110 second 01 Peter, and those ofJ ohn‚which
he considers to have been written subsequently to 150 A.D. With regard to our
Epistle he refers to what he had said before, as to its being copied from 1
Pet. and cites parallels from Romans, Corinthians, Hebrews‚ Apocalypse and
the Gospel of St. Matthew to show that it was written aster these. In reply to
Beyschlag he assei-ts that the J udaizing tone of the Epistle is not the naive
Judaism 01 an early Jewish Christian writer, but that it implies a late stage of
the doctrinal development, inasmuch as it attacks Paulinism as the seed of
an existing Gnosticism. The writer betrays his Essene tendency by his pro-
hibition 01 swearing, his contempt for riches, his dislike of trade, warning
against sins of the tongue, high esteem of poverty, &cz He takes the pseu-
donym of J 1111105, as a contemporary had taken that of Peter ; because the tra·
ditional reputation of the ascetie president of the Ohureh 01 Jerusalem seemed
likely to give most authority to his teaching. Partly in order to imitate his
style, partly to mark his own opposition to all that was characteristic of Paul,
he makes 1150 01 the simple salutation χαίρειν, which he found in a circular
ascribed to J ames in the Acts. The address to the Twelve Tribes of the
Diaspora cannot be taken literally. The true address reveals itself in the
phrase ‘your synagogue' (ii. 2), by which we are in all probability to under—
stand a little conventicle of Essene Christians at Rome. The phrase ‘ Diaspora ’
denotes similar seattered conventicles, in which alone ‘the true Israel‚' ‘the
poor,' are to be found. By ‘the 11011,> who occasionally drop into their con-
venticles and so cruelly oppress and persecute the brethrem is meant Chris-
tians outside 01 the conventiale. All the warnings 01 the epistle are meant to
preserve this little tlock from the suares 01 Paulinism.

Itis difficult 101· Englishmen to treat these baseless vagaries with
becoming seriousness. To 115 they at once suggest the great
Shakespearian Qyptogram, or somebody's attempt to prove that the
Aomals of Tacitus were written by a monk 01 the Middle Ages. But ’
that we may not be too hasty in assuming that the new criticism .
has nothing more solid to offer us, we will turn now to a better
known name, and examine what Pfleiderer has to tell us in his
Urclmdstentlzwn, which is an expansion of the Hibbert Lectures
delivered by him 111 1885.

Ηο distinguishes two lines of development in post-Pauline Christianity. The
one, which he calls Christian Hellenism, is represented by the epistle to the
Hebrews‚ which 110 assigns to the end 01 the lst century, the first epistle of
Clement (between 100 and 120 A.D.)‚ the first of Peter (not earlier than Tra·
jan), that of Barnabas (between 120 and 125 A.D.), the epistlcs to the Colos-
sians and Ephesians and the Gospel of John (about 140 A.D.) The other,
which he calls Antignostic Hellenism, marks the period of the Antonines. It
is again subdivided into Catholicized Hellenism and Catholicized Paulinism
