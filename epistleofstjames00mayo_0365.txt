ΠΙ 4-6 NOTEs 105

Seneca Controv. Eme. v. 5 nesciebas quam levibus iynibus quanta incendia
oriantur, and Milton P.L. i. 91 ‘Into what pit thou seest from what
height fallen! There 18 110 force in the objection that this interpreta-
tion gives opposite senses to the same word in the same sentence.
Literally it is ‘what (what-sized) a fire kindles what a forest‚' but the
context interprets the meaning of ‘what' in either case. In Lucian
Hermot. 5 ἡλίκους ἡμᾶς ἀποφαίνεις, οὐδὲ κατὰ τοὺς πυγμαίους ἐκείνους ἀλλὰ
χαμαιπετεῖς παντάπασιν, the context shows the meaning to be ‘how
small.⁷ The reference to a burning forest is common both in the Bible,
as ΡΞ. lxxxiii. 14 ὡσεὶ πῦρ ὃ διαφλέξει δρυμόν, ὡσεὶ φλὸξ κατακαῦσαι ὅρη,
Isa. ix. 18, x. 17, 18, Zech. xii. 63 and elsewhere, as Hom. ll. ii. 455
πῦρ ἀΐδηλον ἐπιφλέγει ἄσπετον ὕλην οὔρεος ἐκ κορυφῆς, Thuc. ii. 77, Pind.

in which ἀνάπτει occurs in N.T. is Luke xii. 49.1

6. ἡ γλῶσσα πῦρ.] PrOV. XVi. 27 (ἀνὴρ ἄφρων) ἐπὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ χειλέων

πῦρ, ib. V. 22 οὗ μὴ κρατήσῃ εὐσεβῶν (ἡ γλῶσσα) καὶ ἐν τῇ φλογὶ αὐτῆς οὐ
καήσονται, 80 some explain Psa. CXX. 4. On the other hand inspira-
tion from above is also symbolized by fire Acts ii. 3, Isa. vi. 6,
J er. v. 14.

ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ γλῶσσα. καθίσταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεα-ιν ἡμῶν] The first
point to be determined in this difficult verse is whether we should put
our stop after πῦρ with the RV„ WH.‚ Neander, Lange, Hofmann,
Erdmann, Beyschlag3 or after ἀδικίας with the margin, Alf„ Huther,
Schegg and the generality of editors, It seems to me that the former
gives the only tenable construction. The sense may be difficult, but
the grammar is clear, if we take ἡ γλῶσσα as subject to καθίσταται, With
the attributive clause ἡ σπιλοῦσα-γεέννης, and make ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας
the predicate or complement. With the other punctuation ἡ σπιλοῦσα
becomes the predicate, but there 18 110 justification for the article:
either we should have καθίσταται σπιλοῦσα Or καθίσταται τὸ σπιλοῦν
(μέλος) ; and in either case καθίσταται 10868 its proper force. The predi-
cate 18 put first for emphasis, as in John i. 1 Θεὸς ἣν ὁ Λόγος, ib. iv. 24
πνεῦμα ὃ Θεός, 2 Pet. ii. 17 ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός μου οῧτός ἐστιν, Luke iv.
41 τὸν Χριστὸν αὐτὸν εἶναι, see Winer‚ p. 689 f. AS κόσμος is defined by
the genitive τῆς ἀδικίας, it necessarily keeps the article in the predicate,
cf. Apoc. xix. 13 κέκληται τὸ ὄνομα αὑτοῦ ὁ Λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ, 1 Cor. xi. 3
παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἡ κεφαλὴ ὁ Χριστός ἐστιν, Winer‚ p. 141. The fact that
the subject ἡ γλῶσσα 18 repeated from the preceding clause of course
facilitates the transposition of the predicate. We may suppose that

¹ the form of the sentence as it first occurred to the writer was ἡ γλῶσσα

πῦρ, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας; and that for the sake of clearness he added
the remaining words.

¹ [On fires kindled by the tongue 866 Midr. Rabb. on Levit. (xiv. 2) xvi. where
the words are almost the same as those in St. J ames, quanta incendia linqua amitat ,Ι
and Schoettgen p. 1021. C.T.]
