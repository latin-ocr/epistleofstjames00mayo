l 25, 26 NOTES 69

παραμείνας.] Contrasted with the previous ἀπελήλυθε, as παρακύψας
with κατενόησε. Of. ‚John viii. 31 ἐὰν μείνητε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ...γνώ-
σεσθε τὴν ἀλήθειαν κτ.λ., Luke ii. 19, 51, ib. viii. 15, Deub. xxvii. 20
ἐπικατάρι, τος πᾶς ἅνθρωπος ὃς οὐκ ἐμμένει ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λόγοις τοῦ νόμου
τούτου ποιῆσαι αὐτούς, Philo Μ. 1. p. 180 τό γε ἁψαμένους τῆς ἐπιστήμης
μὴ ἐπιμεῖναι ὅμοιόν ἐστι τῷ γεύσασθαι σιτίων, Diod. ii. 29 ὀλίγοι παραμέν-
ουσιν ἐν τῷ μαθήματι (he is conbrasting the superficial study and the
absence of fixed principles among the Greeks wibh bhe opposite among
the Chaldeans). The pai-able, as Oecumenius remarks, is incomplete,
omitting to give the case of one who makes full use of the mirror, 01·
rather blending the figure wibh bhe interpretabion in the word παρακύψας.

ἀκροατὴς ε’πιλησμονῆς.] For ‘ohe gen. of quality see below ii. 4 κριταὶ
διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν, iii. 6 ὃ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας (where see note), also
Essay 011 Grammar, and WViner p. 297. The only othei· passage in which
ἐπιλ. occurs in all Greek literature is Sir. xi. 25 κάκωσις ὥρας ἐπιλησμονὴν
ποιεῖ τρυφῆς. According to Meineke’s correction of a scholium 'co
Aristophanes (Fr. Com. ii. p. 223) the form was also used by Crabinus.
The usual form is ἐπιλησμοο-ύνη. Other examples of such double forms
will be found in Class. Rev. ii. 243.

ποιητὴς ἕργου.] This does not} correspond exactly Lo the preceding
phrase, as the genitive here is objective. A inore exact, opposite would
have been π. φιλεργίας or ἐπιμελείας. The present, phrase suggests such
an opposite as· ἀκροατὴς φωνῆς. lt acquires however a qualitative force
by dwelling upon and intensifying the meaning of the word ποιητής.
We have above π. λόγου ν. 22 and below π. νόμου iv. 11.

oss-ros] See above V. 23.

μακάριος.Ῑ Cf. V. 12 above, and John xiii. 17 εἰ ταῦτα οἴδατε μακάριοί
ἐστε ἐὰν ποιῆτε αὐτά, Seneca Ep. lxxv. 7 mm, ess beatus qui scit «illa secl
qui facit.

ὲν τῇ ποιήσει.] Only here in N.T. In occurs in Sir. xix. 18 ἐν πάσῃ
σοφίᾳ ποίησις νόμου, li. 19 ἐν ποιήσει νόμου ὃιηκριβωσάμην.

26. δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἴναι.] Here we have another source of sels-deceptioni,
nob in hearing, but in saying and doing. ff. Erasmus : Qui Jmlaz‘swmm
sapiunt reliyz'om's laudem constituwzt in palliis ac phylacteriis, «ι’νι delectu
ciborum, in lotionibus, in prolimis precibus ceterisque ceremoniis. Δοκεῖ
is used in N.T. either impersonally = (l) ‘seems' as Acts xxv. 27
ἄλογόν μοι δοκεῖ, (2) ‘seems good’ as Luke i. 3 ἔδοξε κάμοί; 01· per-
sonally (l) of others, Acbs xvii. 18 ξένων δαιμονίων δοκεῖ καταγγελεὺς
εἶναι, (2) of a man's self‚ ‘thinkss as here. In this last meaning
bhe word is used absolutely (a) Matt. xxiv, 44 ᾗ ὥρα οὐ ὃοκεῖτε; 01-
(b) with ὅτι Μαῖα vi. 7 δοκοῦσιν ὅτι εἰσακουσθήσονται; 01· (ο), as
here, wibh infinitive relabing to same subject, cf. John V. 39 δοκεῖτε ἐν
αὐταῖς ζωὴν ἔχειν, 1 Cor. iii. 18 εἴ τις δοκεῖ σοφὸς εἶναι, ib. Viii. 2,
x. 12, xiv. 37, Gal. vi. 3. In some cases (eg. Gal. iit 6, Phil. iii. 4)
in is disputed whebher ‘ seem' or ‘think’ is the right rendering.
Here the question is decided by bhe following ἀπατῶν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ.

θρησκός] diff. λεγ. The word θρησκεία OCCUI'S Acts xxvi. 5 κατὰ τὴν
ἀκριβεστάτην αἵρεσιν τῆς ἡμετέρας θρησκείας ἔζησα Φαρισαῖος, COl. ii. 16
θρησκεία τῶν ἀγγέλων, and the compouncl ἐθελοθρησκεία <sels—imposed
