ccvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

sent it to the ‘ upper barbarians‚' whom he explains to be the Jews
beyond the EuphrateS, &c.; he afterwards made a translation into
Greek, χρησάμενός τισι πρὸς τὴν ἹΞλληνίδα φωνὴν συνέργοις.1

Tho Bishop considers that these parallels make it probable
α priori that the Epistle was written in Aramaic. He supports
this conclusion by the assumption that St. James could not
have written such Greek as that in which the Epistle has come
down to us, containing, as it does, many words with classica] rather
than biblical associations, and implying a wide range of classical
reading.2

‘ This rich vocabulary is not unlike that which may have been
possessed by a professional interpreter, but is very remarkable if
we attribute it to an unlearned J ew writing perhaps the earliest
book of the N.T.’

Lastly the hypothesis of an Aramaic original is supported by a
comparison between our present Greek text and that which must
have been the parent of the Corbey version (pp. 136—144). The
most remarkable of these divergences are the omission of τῆς
πίστεως in i. 33 the translation of τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα by
‘ modicam oburnbratz'onis’ (εροπὴ ἀποσκιάσματος) in i. 173
blasphemant in bono nomino for βλασφημοῦσι τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα
ii. 7, which Bp. W. compares with v. 10 and v. 15, where the
genitives τῆς κακοπαθίας and τῆς ’πίστεως are also expressed by
prepositional phrases, de malis passionibus, in fide, such as might
be used in Hebrew or Syriac3 eoeploratores for τοὺς ἀνγνγέλους ii. 25
as in the Syriae and other versions ; ct linyaa iynis seculi iniquitatis
for καὶ ἡ «γλῶσσα πῦρ ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας iii. 6, where the
Peshitto has ‘the tongue is a fire3 the world of iniquity is as it
were a wood’ ; fornicatores for μοιχαλίδες iv. 4 agrees with the
Peshitto ; inconstans for ἀκαταστασία iii. 16, and frater for ἀδελφοί
iv. 11, arc said to be easily explicable as renderings of the same
Hebrew word. Qm‘ araverunt for τῶν ἀμησάντων v. 4, frequens

‘'''lhis ar „tument is founded on certain lists of w‚ords which I found vei) helpsul
in drawing up iny own lists in Ch. IX. Thev contain however some inaecuracies:
e. g. among ‘aclissical non- Septuag, int xxords’ we find αλυκός, ἀμάω, ἀποκυέω,
which occur either in the Ο. Γ. or Apocryphi in the passao'es indicated in mv list;
we find also δίψυχος, which, as fni as I know, is iu ve1 used in profancG nek of any
