ours.' Compare Peter's words to Cornelius, Acts x. 26, and Anton.
Vi. 19 μὴ εἴτι αὐτῷ σοι ὃυσκαταπόνητον τοῦτο ἀνθρώπῳ ἀδύνατον ὑπολαμβάνειν
ἀλλ’ εἴ τι ἀνθρώπῳ δυνατὸν καὶ οἰκεῖον τοῦτο καὶ σεαυτῷ ἐφικτὸν νόμιζε With

ciple (ὣν) see W⁷iner 542—'544 ancl above iii. 5 μικρὸν μέλος ἐστὶ καὶ κ.τ.λ.

Vorst p. 626, Winer p. 584, Lobeck Paral. 523 1011., where analogous
instances are cited from classica] writers, in some of which the dative
is added for precision, as in Dem. 1002. 12 γάμῳ γεγαμηκώς qui rite con-
fecit nuptias, but in others has an intensive force, as Plato Symp. 195
φεύγειν φυγῇ, compare such phrases as κακὸς κακῶς, and in Lat. occidione
occidere, curriculo currere. I cannot understand what should lead De
Wette, Hofmann, Huther, Erdmann to deny this intensive force which
belongs to reduplication in all languages. The last translates ‘ in einem
Gebet betete er,’ and says by this is express-ed ‘ nicht der Charakter der
Ernstlichkeit und Kraftigkeit, sondern die That des Gebets‚' and so, I
suppose, Alford ‘lte prayed with prayer (made it a special matter 01
prayer, not ymiyed earnestly. This adoption of the Hebrew idiom
merely brings out more forcibly the idea 01 the verb)‚' though his
meaning is far from clear. A similar intensive phrase is formed by
the use of the participle, as in 1 Sam. XXVi. 25 ποιῶν ποιήσεις, δυνάμενος
δυνήσῃ, PS. cxviii. 18 παιδεύων ἐπαίδευσε, J er. 111. 22 ἐπιστραφῆτε ἐπιστρέ-
φοντες, Lam. 1. 2 κλαίουσα ἔκλαυσεν. Here the strengbhened phrase
illustrates what the writer intended by the word ἐνεργουμένη.

τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι] The genitive 01 the infinitive is used to express the
purpose of an action in classical writers, as in Thuc. i. 4 τὸ ληστικὸν
καθῄρει ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἰέναι αὐτῷ, bui] the use
is much extended in the Hellenistic Greek. Thus it is found not only
after verbs immediately expressive 01 design, as here and in Isa. v. 6
ταῖς νεφέλαις ἐντελοῦμαι τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι εἷς αὐτὸν ὑετόν, and in the ·
Byzantine Writers, as Malalas XiV. 357 ᾐτήσατο ἡ Αὕγουστα τὸν βασιλέα
τοῦ κατελθεῖν εἷς τοὺς ἁγίους τόπους (cf. Thuc. viii. 40 οἶγγελίαν ἔπεμπον
ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς τοῦ ξυμπαρακομισθῆναι), but it is used also to denote the
consequence Of an action, as in Acts 111. 12 ὡς πεποιηκόσι τοῦ περιπατεῖν
αὐτόν, and even for the simple infinitive, when it stands as subject of
the sentence, as in Luke xvii. 1 οἷνενδεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ
ἐλθεῖν, Acts X. 25 ἐγένετο τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν τὸν Πέτρον, see wimer, p. 408 foll.
The verb βρέχει is here used, like ὕει, without a subject, as in Luke
xvii. 29: we have the personal use in Matt. v. 45 (ὁ Θεὸς) βρέχει ἐπὶ
δικαίους καὶ ἀδίκους.
