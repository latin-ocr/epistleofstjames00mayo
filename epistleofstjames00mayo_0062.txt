xxxviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

trivialities‚ here there is an originality and simplicity which is not
unworthy of the genuine Gospels themselves.

Hpgstsiwss I pass on now to Hegesippus‚ who is quoted to the following
⁰¹¹ ‘mnes' effect in Euseb. HE. ii. ’23 :

The charge of the Church then (after the Ascension) devolved 011 ,11111183 1118
brother of the Lord in concert with the Apostles. He is distinguished from the
others of the same name by the title ‘ Just ’ (rightcous) which has been applied to
him from the first. He was holy from his mother's wolub, drank no wine or
strong drink, nor ate animal food: no razor came 011 1113 head, nor did he
anoint himself with 011, 01 use the bath. To him alone was it permitted to
enter into 1118 Holy Place, for 118 wore no woollm, but only 1111811. Α1111 alone
he would go into the temple, where he used to be found on his knees, asking
forgiveness for the people‚ so that his knees became hard like a camel's because
he was ever upon them worshipping God and asking forgiveness for the
people. Accordingly through his exceeding righteousness he was called
righteous (‘ Just ') and ⁶ Oblias' which being interpx-eted is ‘the defence of the
people' and ‘righteousness,⁷ 1131118 prophets declared of him.1 Some of the
seven 38813, which I have mentioned, inquired of him, ‘ What is 1118 door of
,183113 (τίς ἡ θύρα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ) ’ἒ '2 And he said that he was the Saviour, where-
upon some believed that. -lesus is the Christ. Now the forementioned sects did
not believe in the resurrection or in the coming of one to recompense each man
according to his works. But 113 many as did believe, believed through sames.
So when many of the rulers believed, there was a disturbance among the Jews
and the Scribes and the Pharisees, saying that there was a danger that all the
people would look to ,183113 as the Christ. They came together therefore and
said to ι11111183 ‘ We pray thee, restrain the people, for they have gone astray in
regard to ,183113 thinking him to be the Christ. We pray thee to persuade all that
have come to the Passover about ,183113 For we all listen to thee. For we and
all the people bear witness that thou art just, and hast no respect of persons.
Do thou therefore stand 011 1118 pinnacle of the temple, so that thou maycst
be conspicuous and thy words may be well heard by all the people, 111111
persuade thern not to go astray about Jesus. For all the tiibes have come
together with the Gentiles also on account of the Passover) Then the fore-
mentioned Seribes and Pharisees set James on the pinnacle of the temple and
cried to him ‘O thou just 0118 10 whom we are all bound to listen, since
the people are going astray after ,183113 who was crucified, tell us what is
the door of Jesus' And he answered with a loud voice ‘Why do you ask 1118
concerning Jesus the Son of Man? He is both seated in Heaven on the right
hand of Power, aud will come 0111118 clouds os heaven.' And when many
were convinced and gave glory at the witness of ι11111183, 111111 cried ‘Hosanna 10
1118 Son of David‚’ the same Scribcs and Pharisces said 10 each other ‘ We
have done ill in bringing forward such a testimony to demis, but let us go up
and cast him down that they may sear to believe hini.' And they cried out
saying ι011, 011, even the just has gone astray' and they fulfillcd that which is
written in Isaiah ‘ Let us take away the just, for he 13 not sor our purpose ;
wherefore they shall eat the fruits os their deeds.' So they went up and they
cast down ,11111183 1118 Just, and said to one another ‘let us stone Jaines the
Just) And they began to stone him, since he was not killed by the sall ; but
