ΙΙ 2-5 NOTES 79

τεῖχος, and see Luke X. 39 παρακαθίσασα παρὰ τοῖνς πόδας τοῦ Κυρίου, Ν),
viii. 35 and Acts xxii. 3.

4. οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς] ‘Are you not divided in yourselves‚’ i.e.
guilty of διψυχία, as in i. ὅ 2 You have not a single eye, but you are in-
duenced by worldly considerations: you look to the world and not to
Christ only. For διεκ. See 011 i. 6, and ἀδιάκριτος iii. 17. For ἐν ἑαυτοῖς
instead of ἐν ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς see i. 22 n. and cf. Mark xi. 23 διακριθῇ ἐν τῇ
καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ. For construction ἐὰν εἴπητε...οὐ διεκρίθητε, aor. instead of
future 01· present, cf. 1 Cor. vii. 28 ἐὰν γαμήσῃς οὐκ ἥμαρτες, John xv. 6
ἐὰν μή τις μένῃ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐβλήθη ἔξω καὶ ἐξηράνθη, Dein. FJJ. p. 411 κᾶν
ἀναγκασθῇ που συντυχεῖν ἀπεπήδησεν εὐθέως. I think 1110 aorist in such
passages commonly expresses the immediateness of the consequence ‘if
ye speak thus, ye are thereby shown to be,' ef. n. on i. 24 on a similar
use of the perfect. In 1 Cor. vii. 28 it seems to show a wish on the
part of the apostle to repudiate at once any idea of blaming a man for
marrying, ‘if you should marry, I don’t mean to say it was wrong in
you to get marriedss see Winer p. 366 and Devarius 11. 451 there
referred to3 Goodwin ἐ 155. Others take it as the gnomie aorist
expressing a general fact, on which see i. 11, 24.

κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν.] ‘ WVrOng-Considering ju(1geS,' gen. Os
quality like ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς above i. 25, 5 κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας below
iii. 6, κρίσιν βλασφημίας Jude 9. Any one who speaks against his
neighbour becomes a κριτής, as we read below iv. 11. The reference
here is to the worldly considerations of expediency which made them
pay court to the rich and slight the poor. The phrase occurs also in
Matt. XV. 19 ἐκ τῆς καρδίας ἔρχονται διαλογισμοὶ πονηροί, an example of
such διαλογισμοί 15 given Luke v. 21, 22, Rom. i. 21, see Hatch p. S.

5. ἀκούσατε.] One of the rousing words employed by St. James, like
μὴ πλανᾶσθε 1. 16, ἄγε νῦν iv. 13. It is not used in 1110 other epistles.
[n the Gospels and Apocalypse we find the still more urgent 5 ἔχων οὓς
ἀκουσάτω. The simple ἀδελφοί of v. i. is here repeated in a more
affectionate form, as i. 16, 19 repeat 1. 2.

{fidigna-rm] Used (in middle voice only) of the choosing of Israel
Deut. xiv. 1, 2, and of the ‘ elect ' Eph. i. 43 St. Paul speaks in much
the same way 1 Cor. i. 27 τὰ μωρὰ τοῦ κόσμου ἐξελέξατο 5 Θεός κ.τ.λ.
and our Lord, Luke xviii. 25, Matt. xi. 5. 25.

τοὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ.] ‘Poor to the world' 1.0. in the world's
judgment‚ ‘ outwardly poor‚' see below iv. 4 and Luke xii. 21 5
θησαυρίζων ἑαυτῷ καὶ μὴ εἷς Θεὸν πλουτῶν. For a similar antithesis of
the outwardly poor and inwardly rich cf. above i. 9 5 ταπεινὸς ἐν τῷ
ὕψει, 1 Tim. vi. 17, 18 τοῖς πλουσίοις ἐν τῷ νῦν αἰῶνι >< πλουσίοις ἐν ἔργοις
καλοῖς.1 So of the two kinds of wisdom below iii. 15 and 1 Cor. iii. 19
ἡ σοφία τοῦ κόσμου μωρία παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ ἐστίν. For dative cf. Acts vii. 20
ἀστεῖος τῷ Θεῷ, 2 Cor. X. 4 δυνατὰ τῷ Θεῷ, 1 Cor. iX. 2 ἄλλοις οὐκ εἷμὶ
ἀπόστολος, VViner p. 265. On πτωχός 500 Hatch p. 73. It is the
regular word for ⁴ poor' in N.T.

πλουσίους ἐν πίει-πμ] Oblique predicate, after ἐξελέξατο. This verb 15
sometimes used absolutely, as in Mark xiii. 20, 1 Cor. i. 27 ; sometimes
