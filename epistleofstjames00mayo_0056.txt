xxxii THE EPISTLE OF sT. JAMES

Joseph himself becomes a type of virginity: the ‘ brethren ' are no
longer his sons, but sons of Clopas, who was either his brother by
one tradition, or his wife's sister's husband by another. Mary is
made the child of promise and of miracle like Isaac, though not
yet exalted to the honours of the Immaculate Conception; andrwe
see Epiphanius already feeling his way to the doctrine of her
Assumptimi, which was accepted by Gregory of Tours in the sixth
century. One other development may be uoticed, as it is found in
the Protea-amelium c. 20, though not mentioned by Epiphanius,
viz. that not only the Conception but the Birth of our Lord was
miraculous3 in the words of Jeremy Taylor ‘Hc that came from his
grave fast tied with a stone and signature, and into the college of
the Apostles, the doors being shut. ..came also (as the Church
piously believes) into the world so without doing violence to the
virginal and pure body of his mother, that he did also leave her
virginity entire.' 1

This miracle, superfluous as it is and directly opposed to the words
of St. Luke (ii. 23), is yet accepted by Jerome and his followers3 and
it is in reference to it that Bp. Lightfoot (Le. p. 271), thinks that too
much stress has been laid by modern writers on the false asceticism
of the early Church as the only cause of the dislike to the Helvidian
view. He considers that this dislike is ‘ due quite as much to another
sentiment which the Fathers fantastica] ly expressed by a comparison
between the conception and the burial of our Lord. As after death his
body was placed in a sepulchre wherein never man before was laid,
so it seemed fitting that the womb consecrated by His presence
should not thenceforth have borne any offspring of man.' So we
find Pearson (Croesi, p. 326) ⁶citing Ezek. xliv. 2 ‘This gate shall be
shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it;
because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore
it shall be shut’ in proof of the ἀειπαρθενιά. Whether this senti-
ment is to be regarded as something independent of the idea of the
impurity of marriage or as a natural offshoot of it, which I should
be rather inclined to believe, is not of much importance. The only
question worth considering is: Are these sentiments so authorita-
tive as to justify us in twisting the words of the Scripture narrative

Chrys Hom. cxlii. (ap. Suioer, ii. p. 306) ὁ Χριστὸς προῆλθεν ἐκ μήτρας καὶ ἄλυτος
ἔμ εεεεε ἡ μήτρα, and it was allii-med in the 79th Canon of the Couneil in Trullo
towards the end of thc scvcnth century.
