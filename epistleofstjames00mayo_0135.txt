Ptolemy I. (Jos. B. J. ii. 18. 7, Aut. xii. 1). Ptolemy also planted

ς colonies of Jews in Cyrene and the neighbourhood (Jos. e. Ap. ii.
4, Ant. xiv, 7. 2). In the reign of Ptolemy Philometor (13.0. 180-

'¹ 145) a temple modelled after that at Jerusalem was built at Leon-
topolis for the Egyptian Jews, whose number is estimated at not
less than one million by Philo (in lr‘lace. M. 2 p. 523). The same
reasons which led to the Jews being established by their Mace-
} donian conquerors in Egypt, led to their being established also in
the Greek towns founded in the East by the Seleucid dynasty.
‘ The J ews,' says Mommsen, ‘ had a conspicuous share in the
Hellenizing of the East ²: they were chosen for this purpose ‘from
their pliancy and serviceableness on the one hand and from their
unyielding tenacity on the other? ‘ The Jews of the Greek towns
became Greek-speaking Orientals‚' ‘ the use of the Greek language
was compulsory,' but, to compensate for this, ‘they were allowed
up to a certain degree to govern themselves? ‘ Mesopotamia was
covered with Greek commonwealths,' ‘the inhabitants of Palestine
were only a portion, and not the most important portion, of the
Jews: the Jewish communities of Babylonia, Syria, Asia Minor,
and Egypt were far superior to those of Palestine? (The Provinces,
vol. ii. pp. 8, 162—167 Eng. tr.) The most important of the
Seleucid cities were the Babylonian Seleucia and the Syrian
Antioch‚ in the latter of which special privileges were granted to
the Jews by its founder Seleucus Nicator (J os. Ama xii. 3. 1). At
a later period Antiochus the Great transported 2000 J ewish
families from Babylonia to Phrygia and Lydia (J os. Ant. xii. 3. 4).
The capture of Jerusalem by Pompeius in B.O. 63 led to the
transplantation of Jews to Rome, where they were settled in the
Trans-Tiberine quarter. As early as ΒΕ. 59 Cicero defending
L. Flaccus (ξ 66) speaks of their numbers and audacity in en-
deavouring to influence the judges z scis quanta sit mamas, quanta
concordia, qzcautmn valeat in contionibus} In the same passage he
commends Flaccus for having stopped the exportation of the
sacred tribute from the Jews in Asia to Jerusalem. Beside these
more or less compulsory transplantations‚ the pursuit of commerce
led many Jews to find a home in foreign lands. There is scarcely
a place mentioned in the Acts which is without its synagogue or
