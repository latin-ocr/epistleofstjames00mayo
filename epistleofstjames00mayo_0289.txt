Ι 1, 2] NOTES 31

tation was ‘ Peace ' (which the Peshitto gives here), as in Gen. xliii. 23,
and (epistolary) in ΕΖΝ. iv. 17, v. 7. In 2 Mace. i. 1 we have the Greek
and Hebrew joined, χαίρειν καὶ εἰρήνην ἀγαθήν. Α3 a spoken salutation
we have examples of εἰρήνη in Luke X. 5, xxiv. 36 (cf. Jas. ii. 16) : the
epistolar-y use is found in 3 John 15 εἰρήνη σοι, 1 Pet. v. 14. In the
other epistles these simple greetings are further developed, as χάρις καὶ
εἰρήνη (Rom. i. 7, 1 Cor. i. 3, 2 Cor. i. 2, Gal. i. 3, Eph. i. 2, Phil. i. 2,
Col. i. 2, 1 and 2 Τ11033., Philemon 3, Apoc. i. 4, 1 Pet. i. 2, 2 Pet.
i. 2); in the pastoral epistles and in 2 John we have the fuller form
χάρις ἕλεος εἷρήνη; Jude has ἕλεος καὶ εἰρήνη καὶ ἀγάπη. There is no
preliminary salutation in Hebrews, 1 ὖ 01111, 3 John. We meet with
the final salutation ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰ. X. μεθ’ ῧμῶινίῃ many of the epistleS.
Another final salutation is ἕῤῥωσθε = Lat. valete (Acts xv. 29): see
Heisen Nov. Hyp. pp. 95—144. The use of the form χαίρειν naturally
suggests the identity of the writer of this epistle with 1110 writer of the
circular in the Acts, and is at any rate a strong argument against the
view that our epistle was written towards the close of the first century.
Is it conceivable that, after the introduct-ion of the fuller Christian
salutation, any one professing to write in the name of the most
honoured member of the church at Jerusalem would have fallen back
on the comparatively cold and formal χαίρεινῖ

2. πᾶσαν] Τ1113 does not mean strictly totality of joy, as though there
were no joy besides, but merely denotes a superior degree to μεγάλην
or πολλήν. Possibly the expression originated in an attraction from
πᾶν εἶναι χαράν, and is thus equivalent to ‘entire, unmixed joy.' Of.

language is more measured in 1 Pet. i. 6, ancl Heb. xii. 11 πᾶσα μὲν παιδεία

g χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε] The word χαρά 0011003 the preceding χαίρειν
according to the wont of the writer. See ὗπομονή, τέλειον, λειπόμενοι
just below, and the Essay on Grammar and Style. Χαρά 13 here ground
of rejoicing, as in Luke ii. 10. The salutation might sound like a
mockery to those who were suffering under various trials, but St. J ames
proceeds to show that these very trials are a ground for joy. For the
same realization of what was often a mere phrase of courtesy cf. Eur.
Hec. 426 ΠΟΛ. χαῖρ’ ὦ τεκοῦσα, χαῖρε Κασσάνδρα τέ μοι. ἙΚ. χαίρουσιν
ἄλλοι, μητρὶ δ’ οὐκ ἔστιν τόδε. For the thought cf. Matt. V. 10—15, 1
