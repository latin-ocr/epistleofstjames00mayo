clxviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

PRONOUNS.
De monstrativa

οὗτος used to emphasize the apodosis in i. 23 εἴ τις ἀκροατὴς...
οὗτος ἔοικεν ἀνδρί κ.τ.λ., i. 25 ὁ παρακύψας εἰς νόμον τέλειον...
οὗτος μακάριος. See Winer‚ p. 199. As subject, attracted to the
gendes of the predicative noun, i. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ αὕτη ἐστίν,
ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανούς.

ὅδε, supposed to be used for ὁ δεῖνα, 555 n. on 13, εἷς τήνδε τὴν
πόλιν.

αὐτός = Lat. ipse, emphatic, (α) ordinary use i. 12 ὁ Θεὸς ἀπεί-
ραστός ἐστιν, πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς οὐδένα, ii. 6 (οἱ πλούσιοι) αὐτοὶ
ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς; (b) special Hellenistic use ii. 7 οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασ-
φημοῦσιν, 555 notes on the two verses ι (0) the nom. does not seem
to be used pleonastically‚ as by St. Luke in xxiv, 13, 14 δύο ἐξ
αὐτῶν ἦσαν πορευόμενοι...καὶ αὐτοὶ ὡμίλουν πρὸς ἀλλήλους.

ὁ αὐτός iii. 10 ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ στόματος, ver. 11 ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς
ὀπῆς. St. James does not use αὐτὸς ὁ in this sense, as St. Luke
does in the phrase αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρα (lit. ‘at the very honr ')‚ which
occurs in ii. 38, vii. 21, Acts xvi. 18 and elsewhere.

αὐτός = Lat. is, unemphatic in the oblique cases3 but gaining a
certain emphasis by repetition, as in iii. 9 ἐν αὐτῇ εὐλογοῦμεν καὶ
ἐν αὐτῇ καταρώμεθα; or by position as in St. Luke xxiv. 24⁴ αὐτὸν
δὲ οὐκ εἶδον, ver. 31 αὐτῶν δὲ διηνοίχθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί. It is also
used pleonastically‚ not only in the genitive with the article, as
in the cases mentioned above3 but when occurring in apposition
to the noun, or participle equivalent to noun, as in iv, 17 εἰδότι
καὶ μὴ ποιοῦντι ἁμαρτία αὐτῷ ἐστιν. ’

αὑτοῦ instead of ἑαυτοῦ,1 in i. 18 ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸεῖναι ἡμᾶς
ἀπαρχὴν τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων (ACP have ἑαυτοῦ); i. 26 Tregelles
and Tischendorf read (with Sin. AKL &c.) μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσ-
σαν αὐτοῦ ἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, where I have followed
WH. in reading (with Β-Ι-) ἑαυτοῦ. See also note on V. 20, where
some os the latest editors read ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ.

ἑαυτοῦ is used for σεαυτοῦ in i. 22 γίνεσθε ποιηταὶ καὶ μὴ
ἀκροαταὶ μόνον παραλογιζόμενοι ἑαυτούς, ii. 4 διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυ-
τοῖς. We find however σεαυτόν in ii. ὃ.
