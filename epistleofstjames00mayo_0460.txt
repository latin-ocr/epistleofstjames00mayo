200 COMMENT

St. James ascribes to the flatterers of the rich in his day. Might
does not make right now, any more than it did under Roman
imperialism or mediaeval feudalism. The true way of honouring
the masses‚ if we like to use that term, is first by taking for
granted that they, like the classes above them, are largely made
up of reasonable heings, who desire to learn the honest opinions of all
who have taken the trouble to form opinions for themselves3 secondly,
by oui-selves doing our best to understand their position, listening
with respect to their opinions, and freely pointing out where we believe
them to be mistaken ; thirdly‚ by seeking to make them sharers in all
the civilizing influences of our time, and as far as possible to raise
them to the level of the more favoured classes3 in other words, by
extending as widely as possible the refinement and culture, the self-
respect and sels-control, implied in the old name of ‘ gentleman.' We
may hope that in these and other ways much of the bitterness of
poverty may be done away with, and that the upward path to compe-
tence may be opened to all who are capable of making use of it 3 but
until human nature is entirely regenerated, the ascent of some from
the lowest class is likely to be balanced by the descent of others from
the upper classes. Nor is this in itself to be regretted, poverty and
want being the reformatories provided by nature for the idle and
vicious In time past, it is true, these reformatories have too often
acted as incitements to crime rather than to virtue, because the
sufferers were left to suffer alone, without guidance for the present or
hope for the future. The thought and effert which are now being
applied to schemes for the improvement of the condition of the
‘submerged tenth' will, we may believe, tend to bring out the good,
and neutralize the evil of poverty, while at the same time providing a
safe chan'nel for the exercise of Christian charity.

It is however important to remember that the J ewish law, forbidding
respect of persons, was directed not less against the partiality which
favoni-s the poor, than against that which favours the rich. The
cantion against the former, which we find in Lev. xix. 15, ‘thou shalt
not respect the person of the poor,' is certainly as much needed now as
it ever was.

Sommmrr or Du'rv AND THE LAw OF LIBERTY.

‘He who keeps the law as a whole and fails in one point only is
guilty of all.’ Such a principle would evidently cause great injustice,
if applied in the administration of human laW. A child who steals a
carrot is not thereby guilty of forgery and murder. If the divine law
consisted os rules relating to outward action only, as human law does,
the same would be true of it also, but the perfect law of God, as St.
James tells usin i. 25 and ii. 12, is a law ofliberty. It is fulfilled
only when we freely choose what God commands, when His will
becomes our will, when we love Him because He loved us3 when we
love our neighbours as ourselves‚ because they are children of the
same Father, redeemed by the same Saviour, partakers of the same
