cxviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

indwelling Spirit: but they are still ‘zealous for the law‚' as St.
5011105 describes them in the Acts, they still seem to form one
body with their unbelieving cornpatriots; still, as St. James says
again, ‘hear Moses read to them every sabbath in the synagogues.'
In fact they exhibit an immature stage of Christianity, such as
must have continually been found among those who had become
believers on the day of Pentecost or through the preaching of
some passing evangelist, but were without any regularly organized
system of Christian teaching (James iii. 1 foll).

The arguments of the Tiibingen school, in opposition to the
Jowish nationality of those addressed, will be considered in the
chapter which follows on the Date of tho Epistle. Various in-
cidental expressions have been noticed by editors1 as bearing on
this point. Abraham is called ‘our father' in ii. 21, which in this
straightforward inatter-of-fact Epistle must, by all rules of inter-
pretation, be taken, like the ‘ Twelve Tribes of the Dispersion‚’ in
its literal sense, unless reason can be shown to the contrary. The
readers are supposed to be acquainted with the story of 5011,
Elijah and the prophets (V. 11, 17). Τ110 phrase ‘ Lord of Sabaoth '
(v. 4), the reference to J ewish oaths and to the 5 ewish propensity
to curse and swear (iii. 0, v, 12), the term ‘synagogue' used for
their place of meeting (ii. 1), the high value attributed to the Law
alid to the confession of the Unity of God—all mark the Jewish
nationality of the 10011015, and would be unmeaning or 1110111110-
priate if the Epistlo were addressed to Gentiles. The same thing
appears from the reference to their avarice and their restless
pursuit of wealth (iv. 13-16, v 1—4).

As regards the place from which the Epistle was written, if we
are right in supposing that it was written by the Brother of the
Lord, there can be little doubt that it was dated from Jerusalem.
This supposition is confirmed by incidental allusions to the early
and latter rains (ν. 7), 130 tho effect on vegetation of the burning
wind (1. 11), to the existence of salt and bitter springs (iii. 11), to
the cultivation of figs and olives (iii.12)‚a11d to thc neighbourhood
of tho sea (1. 6, iii. 4).
