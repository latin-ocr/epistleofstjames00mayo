exe 'THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

s I do not of course assert that St. James writes with the same
faeility as St. Paul. The former was evidently a slow ancl careful
writer, while the latter speaks as he is moved, without regard to
aecuraey or ornament, in the provincial Greek which was familiar
to him from childhood. Nor again is it meant that the Greek of our
Epistle is such as could be mistaken for that osa Classical writer.
There are undoubtedly harsh phrases, such as i. 17 τροπῆς ἀπο-
σκίασμα, i. 23 τὸ πρόσωπον τῇς Γγενέσεως, ii. 4 κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν
πονηρῶν, and awkward and obscure sentences, such as ii. 1 μὴ ἐν
προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιί) Τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χρισ-
τοῦ τῆς δόξης, iii. (i ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ Ὑλῶσσα καθίσταται
ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν ἡ . . . φλοιγίζουσί τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως,
iii. 12 μὴ δύναται συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι; οὔτε ἁλυκὸν ’γλυκὺ
ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ, also iv. 5, 6, 17. But Schleiermacher and Dr. S.
Davidson are entirely mistaken when they allege as proofs that
‘the author was not accustomed to write Greek ' such thol-oughly
idiomatic phrases as i. 2 ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε ποικίλοις,
and the admirably emergetis: βουληθεὶς in i. 18 (βουληθεὶς
ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λόγῳ ἀληθείας). Nor can I see that there is any
ground for stuinbling in the use of πορείαις in i. 11 or of ἀπεκύησεν
in i. 18. The latter, it is true, is not a elassical word, but the
question is not, of course, about elassical, but about post-Classical
Greek, in which this word was of general use. If it is objected
that St. -James uses, in the sense of ‘begetting,' a word which
properly means ‘ to bring forth‚' the answer is that both here and
in i. 15 the word is used metaphorically, and that in the Hebrew
Scriptures terms properly employed of the mother are used to
denote God's relation towards mankind.

VOCABULARY.1

Ι proceed now to examine the vocabulary of St. James, giving
lists (1) of the words which are apparently used for the first time
by him, (2) of words used by him alone among biblical writers,
(3) of LXX. words employed by him alone among the writers of
the NJF. It might be useful to draw up similar lists showing the
percentage of Classical and post-Classical words employed by each
of the N.T. writers.

¹ In making this list Ι have been mat‹·.1·ially assisted by the lists given in Thayer’s
Lem'con and in Studia Biblz‘ca, i. p. 149.
