such testis of faith as are not naturally grievouffi in wealth, power,
beauty, popularity, prosperity ,of every kind? Or, yet further, in the
extol-nal temptatisms of the world, the sscsh and the devilz Might
Joscph rojoicc 111 the temptation which caino. to him in Potiphar's
house, as well :ns 111 that which came when his brothers sold him to the
Midianitcs? 'l'lw conquest of plcasiire-temptation is not less useful
as experiencc3 itis not less strcngthening to the character than the
conquest over pain: to have gone through such temptation unscathed
may be the ground of deepest thankfulncss afterwards 3 but the spiri-
tual joy in resisting temptation of which St. dames speaks is not com-
patible with any lower feeling of plcasure. To have suddenly come
into possession of a great fortune is a cause of rejoicing to the natural
inan: one who has a right sense of the responsibilities and the suares
of wealth may shrink from it as a burden, or enter upon it with much
anxiety and sels-suspicion; but we can hardly conceive of such an in-
version of the ordinary view as to allow of a man's rejoicing in wealth
as a trial. St. Janies just below speaks of the poor as rejoicing in his
dignity, but the rich in his humiliation as a Christian—both equally
difficult and the latter especially painful to the natural man. One-
simus and Philemon may both rejoice in the new relation of brother-
hood, which replaces that of slavery and lordship: to the one it may
bear the aspect of a levelling up, to the other of a levelling down3 but
in reality what both rejoice in is the falling into the background of
the old transitory distinction in comptu-ison with their common-fellow-
ship in the eternal glory.

The call to rejoice is of course not exclusively made to those who
are tried. There is a natural joy which is not condemned, but which
needs to be associated with the thought of God to guard it from
becoming a snare to us (ch. v. 13). ‘Rejoice in the Lord always ' is a
universal precept for all Ohristians‚ but one that has to be insisted
upon especially in the case of those whose circumstances naturally
tempt them to sorrow. It is a bracing appeal to them (like St. Paul's
in Eph. vi. 10 foll.) to niuster up all their courage, and to look their
difficulties in the face, seeing in them a Divine discipline, which they
are to accept as sent by Him who knows what is best for them and will
not suffer them to be tempted above that they are able. On the other
hand there is a false joy springing from a confidence in ourselves and
111 0111· circumstances, which shows that we aim at the friendship of the
world, and which necessarily separatas us from God (ch. iv. 4, 16). This
false joy must be exchanged for the sorrow of repentance before the
truc joy can enter our hearts (iv. 9, 10).

In ver. 12 St. James guards against a possible misunderstanding of
the encouragement given in ver. 2. Trial can only be a subject of
rejoicing when it is patiently endured. He who gives way to the
telnptation involved in trial is in no way benefited, but the reverse,
unless, as in the case of St. Peter, his discovery of his own weakness
lcads him to a deeper repentance.

A still more serious error is met 111 ver. 13. Man throws the blame
of his wrong-doing 011 God, who made him what he is, and placed him
