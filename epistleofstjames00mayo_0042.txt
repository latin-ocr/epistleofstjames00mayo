xviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

to show by a rough numerical estimato the force of the pro-
babilities which are really arrayed against it. This will be found
in the note below.²

B.—le Epiphaniam Tltcory.

Ι procced now to examine the Epiphanian view, according to
which the Lord's brothers were sons of Joseph by a former wife.
This was the generally accepted view when Jerome put forward
his new theory, and to a great extent it escapes the difficulties
which, we have seen3 attach to that theory.

Two unimportant objections made both to it and to the Helvidian
ᾖῇξῖᾆῖζῖᾟζξῖξξ theory from the Hieronymian point of view are: (l) that they

1 Even a commentator so little fettered by tradition as Dr. S. Cox writes thus in
the Expositor for Jan. 1890, p. 68: ‘James then (as I hold and shall assume, after a.
careful stud y of the various theorits propounded about him...) was the son of
Alphaeus, otherwise called Clopas, and of his wife, the sister of the Virgin Mary...
Among his brothers were Simeon,..Jude...Joses...and Levi the publican.' It is
curicus that the one authority to which Dr. Cox refers those who care to examine the
controversy for themselves is ‘the admirable summary in Dean Plumptre's commen-
tary‚⁷ where however we read (p. 17) ‘there is absolutely no ground for identisying
the brother ol' the Lord with the son of Alphaeus2

² These who have followed the argument in the text will not, I think, rcgard the
following estimates of the chauces in favour of the several suppositions involved in
the Hieronymian theory as giving an unfair representation of the ease :

(a) for the use of ἀδελφός for cousin iu the phrase ἀδελφὸς Kopion—one out of five
(ὲ), making 4 to 1 against it.

(b) for the brethren of the Lord being included in the Twelve—one out of ten (ἧς),
making 9 to 1 against z't. ’

(c) for the supposed sons of Clopas-Alphaeus being always found in company—-
noc with their own mother, who was certainly still living‚—but with their aunt,
residing with her and hur Son, and taking on themselves to control the actions of
the latter—one out of ten (ἡ), making 9 to l against ic. .

(d) sor two sisters having the same name—one out of ten (ᾖς), making 9 to 1 τ
a ains-l a.

quiere are various other improbabilities, some of which have been already touched

on, and others of even greater weight will appear in treating of the Epiphaniun ,
view, but 1 should be willing to rest the ease on the four points here named, giving '

a resultant probability insavoar of the siniultaneous realisation of the four above-

stated hypotheses of —1- 1 7, making 4999 probabilities to 1 ayainst
