naxus] ‘WVionglyss as in John xviii. 23 εἰ κακῶς ἐλάλησα. It is
explained by the words which follow, a'nd 13 the opposite to 1 John v.
14’ εάν τι αἰτώμεθα κατὰ τὸ θελημα αυτοῦ ἀκούει ἡμῶν, (31.1311 lix.

Theophylact on Luke xviii. 42 ἐπεὶ ἄλλα αἰτοῖντες ἄλλα λαμβάιομεν
πρόδηλον ὅτι οὗ καλῶς οἶδὲ πιστῶς αἰτοῖμεν. This W10ng pray el is
without submission (v. 7); the petitioner uses it as an instrument
of selfishness 3 he would make religion a help to scrving the world, cf.
1 Τ1111. vi. 4, 5.

ἵνα. ἑν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν δαπανήσητε.1] Cf. Luke XV„ where δαπανήσαν-
τος αΰτοῦ πάντα (V. 14) is explained by ὃ καταφαγών σου τὸν βίον μετὰ
πορνῶν (v. 30). The object here is understood from αἰτεῖτε. In Acts
xxi. 24 δαπ. 13 followed by ἐπί, 111 classical writers usually by εἷς, but
also by πρός, ἀμφί, or the simple dat. 3 there is however no occasion to
separate ἐν from the verb (as Alf), cf. Thuc. vii. 48. 5 ἐν περιπολίοις
ἀναλίσκοντας, where Poppo cites Arist. ECJL. iv. 2. 20 ἐν τοῖς μικροῖς τῶν
δαπανημάτων πολλὰ ἀναλίσκει, Aristid. adv. Lept. p. 62 τὴν ἐν τοῖς τοιού-
τοις δαπάνην, and compares Lat. consumere in re. The extreme of this
δαπάνησις iS seen in the ἐτρυφήσατε and ἐσπαταλήσατε Of V. 5. Prayer
for this is the opposite to prayer for daily bread, and to Matt. vi. 32,
33 ‘ seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added
unto you, for your Father knoweth ye have need of these things.
Compare the conclusion of Juvenal’s tenth Satire.

4. μοιχαλίδες] Recent editors follow A. B. Sin. in omitting μοιχοὶ
καί, and understand the word in a figurative sense of adulterous 301113,
111 accordance with the language of the O.T.‚ which speaks of Israel as
married to Jehovah (Isa. lvii. 3—9, Jer. iii. 20, Ezek. 16 esp. vv. 32, 35,
38, ib ch. 23, Hosea ch. 2), and of the NT. which speaks of the Church
as the Lamb's Wife (2 Cor. xi. l 2, Eph. v. 22- -32, Apoc. xix. 7, 1ᾛό
ΧΧ1. 9). It is less usual to find this figule used to express the
relation of the individual soul to God, but cf. Psa. lxxiii. 27, Rom.
Vii. 2—4, Clem. Hom. 111. 28 ὁπόταν ἡ ψυχὴ ὑφ’ ἑτέρων σπαρῇ, τότε, ὡς
πορνεύσασα ἦ μοιχευσαμένη, ὑπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματος ἐγκαταλείπεται. 'she
insertion of μοιχοί was natural when μοιχαλίς was understood literally,
but the context and especially ver. 5 are in favour of the figurative

1 B has the fut. δαπανήσετε, as in 1 Pet. iii. 1 ἵνα κερδηθήσονται, Gal. ii. 4 ’ἵνα κατα-

δουλώσουσιν.
