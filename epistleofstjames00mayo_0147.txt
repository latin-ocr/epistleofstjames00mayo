ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxiii

‚Jews nor Gentiles were bound by the Mosaic Law, The work of
James was to lead on men, who were in this stage of religious
belief, to higher views, as they were able to bear it. He was
especially fitted for this work because he was so much in sympathy
with those whom he addressed. By nature slow to move, 116 had
from his childhood loved the Law, as the old psallnists did; 1116
Gospel itself was in his view still the ancient law, revealed at
length 111 115 perfect form, 61111 1111111611 111 1116 11111111 61111 116611 of

down in 1116 Epistle. He wrote doubtless what he believed would
be most useful for the majority of those whom he addresscd.
He could only appeal to motives which would have force with
them, and bnild up his arguments 011 premissos which they would
concede. This perhaps may account for his referring to the
example of Job and the prophets rather than of Christ. Sup-
posing, 65 was probably the 6656, 11161 our Gospels were not yet in
existence, and that the Christian teaching of these -Jews of the
Dispersion was founded on short collections of loyz'a, containing
parables and aphorisms of Christ, it is quite possible that the
details of His-life may have been less familiar to them 111611 1116

every Sabbath day. 81111 each year must have seen more of the
life and teaching of Christ set down in writing3 each year must
have left its impress on the mind of St. James. One who 51)
strenuously did the Father's will must have learnt more and 111016
of the doctrine, and received ever fuller revelation from the Spirit
of truth. 80 far 65 11115 consideration goes, we should bc led to

assign the Epistle to the earliest possible date after the day of
Pentecost.

the reference to persecutions endured by them. The third con-
sideration would forbid 05 to assign 611 earlier date than A.D. 37,
the martyrdom of Stephen, which gave the signal for a great
persecution against the Church at Jerusalem, and which was
followed by the mission of Saul 10 Damascus (and doubtless by
that of other emissaries to other parts of the Diaspora)‚ bearing
