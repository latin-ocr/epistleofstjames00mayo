I V 2 NOTES 127

μεῖτε καὶ οῦκ ἔχετε in the first series? Unsatisfied desire leads to murder
(as in the case of N aboth) ,· disappointed ambition leads to quarrelling
and fighting. Schegg and Beyschlag and Erdmann object to this
grouping of the words as harsh and unlike the style of St. JameS, but
abruptness is a marked characteristic with him, see ii. 19 σὺ πιστεύεις
...Θεός· καλῶς ποιεῖς, V. 6 ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον· οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν.
The only difficulty introduced is that the second series (ζηλοῦτε κ.τ.λ.)
is joined to the first by καὶ instead of standing independently by its
side. Perhaps this may be accounted for by the fact that the figure
asyndeton was already employed to mark the change from the ante-
cedents to the consequents. [Dr. Plummer adopts this punctuation]

Taking it in this way we may compare Epict. Dz'ss. ii. 17 θέλω τι καὶ
οὗ γίνεται· καὶ τί ε’στιν ἀθλιώτερον ἐμοῦ; τοῦτο καὶ ἡ ’Μήδεια οὐχ ὑπομείνασα
ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸ ἀποκτεῖναι τὰ ἴδια τέκνα...ἁπλῶς μὴ θέλε ἢ ἂ ὁ Θεὸς θέλει, καὶ
τίς σε κωλύσει, τίς σε ἇναγκάσει,· Clem. Rom. i. 3 ἕκαστον βαδίζειν κατὰ τὰς
ἐπιθυμίας αὐτοῦ τὰς πονηράς, ζῆλον ἄδικον καὶ ἀσεβῆ ἀνειληφότα, δι’ οὗ
καὶ θάνατος εἰσῆλθεν εἷς τὸν κόσμονῑ See Lightfoot on this and the
following paragraph, where he cites Clem. Hom. iii. 42 Κάϊν ἑρμηνεύεται
ζῆλος, and Iren. iv. 18. 3 3 also Clem. Rom. i. 4 ὁρᾶτε, ἀδελφοί, ζῆλος καὶ
φθόνος ἀδελφοκτονίαν κατειργάσατο, where their effect is traced through a
long series of examples : ib. 6 ζῆλος καὶ ἔρις πόλεις μεγάλας κατέστρεψεν καὶ
ἔθνη μεγάλα ἐξερίζωσεν.

But may it not be that we ought, with Erasmus, followed by Calvin,
Beza, Hottinger, Ewald, to read φθονεῖτε, supposing this to have been
carelessly written φονεῖτε (which indeed we find in the text, though not in
the note, of Oecumenius), and corrected into φονεύετεΖ Α similar corrup-
tion may have given rise to the reading φθόνοι, φόνοι in Gal. v. 21. where
φόνοι is omitted by the best MSS. Conversely in Olem. Hom. ii. 11,
φθόνου is Wrongly given in the MS. for φόνου. Certainly the process of
thought is thus made easier. Accepting this change of reading, we
shall have only the last result, ‘ye fight and war,' following the two ante-
cedentS, ‘ye lust and have not ’, ‘ ye are envious and jealous and cannot
obtain' : ‘ we thus see the words ἡδονῶν στρατευομένων fitly associated
with πόλεμοι καὶ μάχαι, and these words anticipating μάχεσθε καὶ πολε-
μεῖτε’ (Hoskyns-Abrahall in Ost. iii. p. 314). Internal unrest (ἡδοναὶ
στρατευόμεναι ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν) in its two stages—desire without posses-
sion (of a thing), envy and jealousy which bring us no nearer our ain]
(of a person)—-is followed by outward disturbance (μάχεσθε καὶ
πολεμεῖτε). Compare the stages of ἐπιθυμία in i. 14, 15. If it is once
recognized that, whatever punctuation we adopt, φονεύετε can only be
taken here in its literal sense, it must be allowed that it disturbs the
natural order, and strikes, as it were, a false note between the πόλεμοι
and μάχαι of ver. 1 and the μάχεσθε and πολεμεῖτε of V. 2.

ἐπιθυμεῖτε καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε] b’oth words are used absolutely as in Rom.
xiii. 9 (ἐτι-ιθ), Matt. XXV. 29 τοῦ μὴ ἔχοντος καὶ ὃ ἔχει ἀρθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ,
2 Cor. viii. 12 καθὸ ἐὰν ἔχῃ εὐπρόσδεκτος, οὐ καθὸ οὐκ ἔχει.

(φθονεῖτε) καὶ ζηλοῦτε] On the difference between them see Thuc. ii. 64
