IV 4, 5 NOTES 131

καθίσταται.] ‘ Thereby becomes,’ lit. ‘is constituted‚' see on iii. 6.

5. ἢ sonim] The alternatives are, either the friendship of the world
is enmity with God, or the Scripture speaks without meaning. Cf.
Matt. xxvi. 53 ἦ δοκεῖς ὅτι οὐ ὃύναμαι; 2 Cor. Xi. 7, Rom. Vi. 3. For
δοκ. see above i. 26.

κενῶς.] Epic-t. Dz'ss. ii. 17. 6 ἢ κενῶς φθεγγόμεθα ;

ἡ γραφὴ λέγει.] The same phrase is used Rom. iv. 3, V. 17, x. 11, Gal.
iv. 30, 1 Tim. V. 18, cf. above ii. 23, and &Vestcott Heb. p. 474 on
modes of citation. For the personification see Lightfoot on Gal. iii. 8.
To show the incompatibility of being at the same time friends with
the world and friends of God, the writer refers to the mode of speaking
common in the O.T. where jealousy is ascribed to God.

No passage in the O.T. exactly corresponds to this. The nearest are
Gen. Vi. 3-7, Exod. XX. 5 ἐγὼ γάρ εἶμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, Θεός ζηλωτής,
expanded in the Song of Moses, Deut. xxxii. (esp. vv, 11, 12, 16, 19,
21 παρεζήλωσοὶν με ἐπ’ οὐ Θεῷ, Cf. l Cor. X. 22), EXOd. XXXiV. 14, 15, Isa.
lxiii. 8-16, Zech. viii. 2 ἐζήλωκα τὴν Σιὼν ζῆλον μέγαν καὶ θυμῷ μεγάλῳ
ἐζήλωκα αὐτήν.. ἐπιστρέψω ἐπὶ Σιὼν καὶ κατασκηνώσω ἐν μέσῳ Ἰερουσαλήμ.
Some Commentators (eg. Ewald) have thought the allusion must be to
some lost writing. Others (Ke1·n,Bouman, XViesinger, Hos mann) think
that the words following ἡ γραφὴ λέγει down 10 διό are parenthetic, and
that St. J ames is already referring to the quotation from Prov. iii. 34 given
in v. 6. But there seems no justification for such a sudden break 3 and
we have other instances of quotations in the N.T. which remind us
rather of the general sense of several passages, than of the actual words
of any one particular passage in the O.T.: see Alf. on 1 Cor. ii. 9 (which
Jerome rightly takes as a paraphrase of Isa. lxiV. 4, while Chrysostom
was in doubt whether it was not fron] some lost book) ; Eph. V. 14 prob-
ably a loose paraphrase from Isa. lx. 1, 2 3 Rom. xi. 8 made up of Isa.
xxix. 10 (Alfi, but vi. 10 Jowett) and Deut. xxix. 4 3 John vii. 38 where
WVestcott's n. is ‘the reference is not to any one isolated passage, but
to the general tenor of such passages as Isa. lviii. 11, Ζ6611. xiv, 8 taken
in connexion with the original image (Exod. xvii. 6, Num. xx. ll)';
Matt. 11. 23 (which Alf. leaves ‘as an unsolved difficusty’), and the
differing versions of the same quotation in Heb. viii. 8 f. and x. 16 f.
For an account of the various explanations offered here, see Wolf.

πρὸς ᾠθόνον ἑπιποθεῖ.] ‘J ealously desires,' cf. 1 Ρ61. ii. 2 (as new-born
babes) τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα ἐπιποθήσατε, Phil. i. 8 (God is my witness)
ὡς ἐπιποθῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, Which Lightfoot
translates ‘I yearn after,' adding ‘ the preposition in itself signifies
merely direction, but the idea of straining after the object being thereby
suggested, it gets to imply eagerness‚ cf. Diod. xvii. 101 παρόντι μὲν οὐ
χρησάμενος, ἀπόντα δὲ ἐπιποθήσαςῖ He notices 1116 fact that While 1116
simple πόθος, ποθεῖν, &a are not found in the N.T., the compounds
ἐπιποθεῖν, ἐπιποθιά, ἐπιπόθησις, ἐπιπόθητος are 1101 uncommon. So in
LXX„ Psa. xlii. 1 ὃν τρόπον ἐπιποθεῖ ἡ ἔλαφος ἐπὶ τὰς πηγάς, οὕτως ἐπιποθεῖ
ἡ ψυχή μου πρὸς σὲ ὁ Θεός, Deut. xxxii. 11 ὡς ἀετὸς ἐπὶ τοῖς νοσσοῖς ἐπεπό·
