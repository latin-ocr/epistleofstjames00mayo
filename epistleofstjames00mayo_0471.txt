IV 1-17 THE WORLD 211

passions, the subject-matter of our thoughts. This environment is
partly inanimato, so far as our senses, thoughts, and appetites are con-
cerned, but far more largely human, in all that has to do with feclings,
passions, (1651165. It is the appointed training-placc of the immortal
soul. But just as the iuanimate world, which was intended to reveal 1116
glory 01 1116 eternal Godhead, was itself deified through the folly of man 3
so the world of humanity, which was intended to be a further revelation
01 1116 inner character of God, engrosses our attention until we no
longer hear the voice of God speaking in conscience, but take the
custom of the world for our law, submit ourselves to its judgment,

our God. In speaking of the world we must remember that it is not
one, but multiform. Each 111-(1115 world differs from that of every
other man, depending partly on his surroundings and partly on the
working of his own mind. The same surroundings may be to one man
a channel of divine influence, to another the very einbodiment of the
worldly spirit. Where the mind of one 5665 01 creates good in all
around him, the mind 01 another may be consciens only of evil, and
thus the same set 01 people may constitute a church to the one, a
world 10 1116 other. In like manner there will be a broad distinction
between man's world and woman's world, the world 01 youth and the
world of age, the world 01 poverty and the world of wealth. Fashion‚
politics, religion,—the criminal, the school-boy, the working-man,——all
have their separate worlds3 there is the world 01 the nun in her
convent, 01 1116 hermit in his cell. Incalculable mischief has been
caused by the imagination that the worldly spirit could be avoided by
keeping out of some particular society which men chose to identify
with the world. The world 15 111 the heart 01 man. There may be
endless differences 111 point 01 refinement between the various 1011115
01 the world 3 but in so far as they all tend to separate us from God
and lower our standard 01 duty, the influence of all is alike baneful.
He who makes it his chief aim to gain the favour of his world thereby
becomes an enemy 01 God. And yet all the while each separate 50111,
included in the aggregate 01 worlds, is itself the object of God's love,
though the worldly influence, which in the Bible often goes by the
name 01 1116 world, is so hateful to God that, as we have seen, no man
can love it without becoming His enemy.

St. J ames in the text tells 115 that the cause of quarrelling is our
eagerness to get the world‘s good things, which are palpably limited
in quantity, and often derive their chief value in our eyes from their
difficulty of attainment. The fact of this limitation inevitably leaves
many disappointed 01 their desire. But even the successful are not
satisfied. No sooner is the coveted object attained, than the process
01 disillusion commences. There is a moment's delight at the victory
over our rivals, and again the cloud 01 disappointment settles over 115.
We feel that, once more, happiness has eluded our grasp, and we are
filled with envy and jealousy 01 111056 whom we fancy to be in any
respect more fortunate than ourselves, till in the end we find our
nearest approach to happiness in striving to prevent or destroy the
