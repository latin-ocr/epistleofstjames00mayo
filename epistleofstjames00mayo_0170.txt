cxlvi THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

among a number os co-ordinate virtues. Ι (10 not deny that he
at times uses πίστις in the sense of a mere intellectual belief ; but
when he describes the Christian religion as ‘the saith os our Lord
Jesus Christ' (ii. 1), when he makes saith the essential condition
os all prevailing prayer (i. 6, ν. 15), when he ascribes the begin-
ning of spiritual lise to our regeneration by the word of truth (i.
18) —and how can we receive that word except through the
instrumentality of saith 2—he seems to me to rate saith as highly
as St. Paul himself. Yet even St. Paul sets saith below love, and
goes so far as to say, ‘ Though I have all saith so as to remove
mountains‚ but have not charity, I am nothing?

Ι really cannot see that Pfleiderer has anything else in the way
os argument to offer for his view. All that he tells us is that
towards the middle of the second century the Catholic Ohurch had
very much lost its hold of distinctive doctrine, that it was secular
in tone, and was occupied in controversy with the Gnostics‚ to
whom he considers that allusion is made by James, where he
condemns a psychical and diabolical wisdom, and speaks against
those who judge the law, and who impute to God the blame for
their wrong-doing. Is it were certain that the epistle dated from
this time, we might be justified in supposing such assusions, but as
all probability is against it, we have no reason to go so far to
explain references which would be applicable in any age. The
only difficulty would be in the term ψυχικάς, but this is already
used in the first Epistle to the Corinthians.

Without entering into any discussion as to the correctness os ζ

· Pfleiderer’s estimate of the state of Christianity under the Anto-

nines, and without repeating the positive argument sor the early
date of James, I will simply mention here some characteristics os
the Epist-le which seem to me inexplicable on the hypothesis of
the date given by Pfleiderer. The first, already noticed by

l Beyschlag‚ relates to the heading, ‘ J ames the servant of God.’ It

is quite consistent with the modesty which marks the Epistle
throughout, that James himself should adopt this humble title ;
but is it conceivable that a late writer, wishing to secure a hearing
by the adoption os a famous name, should throw away all the
distinguishing adjuncts‚ Apostle‚ Bishop os Jerusalem, Bishop of
Bishops‚ Brother of the Lord, and call himself plain James, a name
which could attract no attention and excite no interest? Would
