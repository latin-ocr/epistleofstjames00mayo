creature born not for time, but for eternity3 and the authoritative
declaration on the part of God of His saving will in regard to each
child thus brought to Him. In bringing our infants to the font wo
only carry out the principle laid down by St. Paul (l Cor. vii. 14» in
respect to the children of Christian parents, and obey the word of
Christ Himself ⁴ Suffer little children 10 001116 111110 1116.’ If all goes 011
as it should do, we may hope and believe that the child will lead the
rest of his life according to that beginning 3 that there will be a steady
onward growth, as in the case of Timothy, without any deliberate
falling away, such as to require that entire change of heart and life
which we generally understand by the term ‘conversion.' ln this,
which ought surely to be the normal case in a Christian country, the
child is brought up to believe that he has not to win God’s favour by
any special merit of his own, but that 116 15 already redeemed, already
grafted into the true Vine, a participator in the gifts of the Spirit,
and an heir to all the promised blessings of the Gospel, unless by 1115
own neglect he refuses to avail himself of these privileges. And in
such a life as this it does not seem possible to fix on any other moment
as the moment of regeneration, except that in which the parents
proclaimed their intention to bring up their infant as a member of
Christ and a child of God.

It is interesting to observe the acknowledgment of the necessity of
a conversion or new birth even among heathen writers. Some found
this in the initiation of the mysteries, others in the teaching of
philosophy.1

As there are some who attribute a magica] virtue 10 the material
rite of baptism, so there are others who attribute a magica] virtue to
sermons. They support their view by citing such texts as the fol-
lowing : ‘ Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
How shall they hear without a preachersss' (Rom. x. 14, 17); ‘God
hath manifested his word through preaching' (Tit. i. 3). But we
have only to compare the state of things in the early Church with the
state of things which now prevails, in order to see how entirely inap-
propriate such language, literally understood, is to our own time.
When St. Paul thus spoke, it is almost certain that there was no
