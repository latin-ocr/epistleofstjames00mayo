102 THE EPISTLE oF sT. JAMES

an aposiopesis is simply impossible here, and in any ease is opposed
to the style of the writer: it is only suggested as a last resource by
editors who felt'themselves bound to this reading on the mistaken
view ol' tlu· overwlielming evidence in its favour, and in obedience to
the bazan-dous maxim that the more diflicult reading is always to be
preferred. No doubt a copyist will avoid, if lic can, a. difficulty which
stares him in tho face (and this might account for ἴδε being changed,
before the following ἵδου, into either εἱ δέ or ἴδου) 3 but as long as a pro-
tasis has an aporlosis of any sort to follow, it is a matter of indifference
to the copyist whether it adds anything new or merely repeats what is
already included in the protasis. Lachmann proposed to read οὐδέ with
a question instead of εἷ δέ. With ἴδε we get exactly the right sense.
The casual use of the word χαλ. suggests the image to which he calls
liis readers’ attention (so ἰδού introduces a simile in ver. 7). ‘ Lo! in
liorses we use the bit for the purpose of making them obey and thus
control their whole body.’ The less common active imperative is found
along with the middle in Eccles. ii. 1 δεῦρο δὴ πειράσω σε ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ
καὶ ἰ’δε ἐν ἀγαθῷ· καὶ ἰδοὺ καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης, Mat-k iii. 32 and 34,
ἰδοὺ ἡ μήτηρ σου...ἵδε ἡ μήτηρ μου, Matt. xxv. 6 and 22, xxvi. 51
and 66, John xvi. 29 and 32, (4211. ἴδε ν. 2, ἰδού i. 20 z St. Luke
always uses ἰδού. The difference between them is well given by
Donaldson (in Winer. p. 319): ‘the middle often exhibits a signifi-
cation which might be called intensive, but which really implies an
immediate reference to some result in which the agent is interested.
One of the commonest cases is that of the aorists ἰδεῖν and ἰδέσθαι, of
which the former means simply “to see‚'' the latter “to behold, to look
with interest '⁷ . . . for this reason ἰδού is more frequently used than ἴδε
in calling attention to something worth seeing.’ So here ἴδε is ‘lo!'
ἰδού ‘ behold,’ the latter calling attention to various particulars about
the s‘hip. Cf. a similar change below iv. 3 from αἰτεῖσθαι to αἰτεῖν.

τῶν ἵππων] The gen. is here put in an emphatic place to mark the
comparison. It belongs both to χαλινούς and to στόματα, probably
more to the former as distinguishing it from the human bridle‚ so we
have ἄχρι τῶν χαλινῶν τῶν ἵππων Apoc. xiv. 20, ἐπὶ τὸν χαλινὸν τοῦ ἵππου
Zech. xiv. 20. Compare Psa. xxxii. 9.

βάλλομεν] Mild force, as in ἐκβάλλω above ii. 25, cf. Ael. VJl. ix. 1ss
ἵππῳ ἐμβάλλειν χ, Xen. De ‘re equesl. vi. 7, ix. ἓ).

εἰς τὸ πείθεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἡμῖν] (fif. ΚΘΗ. (fyr. iv. 3. Ε) πείθεται ὁ ἵππος
χαλινῷ, Soph. Ant. 483, Philo M. 1. p. 21. The subject of the infinitive
is spemfied, as in i. 18 εἷς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἀπαρχήν, iv. '21 διὰ τὸ μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι
ὑμᾶς, iv. 15 ἀντὶ τοῦ λέγειν ὑμᾶς.

1. ἰὸοὐ,] Only found as an i11te1·je‹·tion in NT. See below ver. 5, V.
4, 7, 9, ll, and compare (ἵγε νῦν, ἴστε, ἀκούσατε.

καὶ τὰ armam] For this comparison see Arist. illeclaean. 5 τὸ πηδάλιον
μικρὸν ὒν καὶ ἐπ’ ἐσχάτῳ τῷ πλοίῳ τοσαύτην δύναμιν ἔχει ὥστε ὑπὸ μικροῖ·
οἴακος καὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου δυνάμεως καὶ ταύτης ἠρεμαίας μεγάλα κινεῖσθαι
μεγέθη molum, Ι411οΓ- iV- 900. The two figures are united Plut. JJor.
p. 33 F, Philo M. l, p. 131 ἐπειδὰν ὁ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡνίοχος ἦ κυβερνήτης ὁ νοῦς
