ΤΗΕ writer calls hiniself‘ 51001)’ (hom which 0111 11111161111111151
is derived through the Italian‘ 0111001110 ’,) and describes 1111115611 15
‘a servant of God and of the Lord 565115 Ch1istf As the name
was very common in the fnst century, and the deseiiption is
one which is applicable to all Christians‚ it 15 evident that he
1111151 have been distinguished from other Jacobs by positi on 01
character, so as to 1 ustify him in addressing the ‘Twelve Tribes 'in
the Dispersion' with the tone of authority which is so marked a
&iture in the Epistle before 115. Τ1115 inference receives support
froin the Epistle of Jude, the writer of which styles himself
‘ servant of 565115 Christ and brother of 5 acob‚' evidently assuming

that his brother's name would carry weight with those whom he
addresses.

The Epistle of Jacob, or James‚ is strongly contrasted not ‘¹¹¹ ¹¹¹

only with the Epist-les to the Romans and Galatians, against which
some have supposed it to be directed, but also with the First
Epistle of St. Peter, which in some points it closely resembles,
The general characteristic by which it is distinguished from these
Epistles is its Jewish tone of thought, style and doctrine. In style
’11 reminds 0116 now of the Proverbs‚ now of the stem denuncia—
110115 of the prophets, now of the parables in the Gospels. It has
scarcely any direct reference to Christ, who is indeed only
named twice.1 In cornmending the duty of patience (V. 7—11)‚
the writer refers, with the Psalmist (cxxvi. 6), to the example
of the husbandman, and to 501) and the prophets of the Old
Testament: if he alludes to our Lord at all, he only does so
obscurely in ver. 6 ‘ye killed the just; he doth not resist you’3
