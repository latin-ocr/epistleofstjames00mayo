xlviii THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Epistles styled Catliolic is said to be by James the Lord's brother.
But Ι must remark that it is held by some to be spurious.
Certainly not many old writers have mentioned it, as neither have
they the Epistle of Jude, which is also one of the seven so-called
Catholic Epistles’ (ih. ii. 23). His own practice, however, betrays
no suspicion of its genuineness, as in one passage he quotes James
iv. 11 as Scripture (C'omm. in Psalm. p. 648 Montf.), in another
quotes J ames V. 13 as spoken by the holy Apostle (ih. p. 247).
The doubt as to the canonicity of the Epistle in early times
is sufficiently shown by its omission from some of the early
versions and catalogues of Sacred Books. Thus it is omitted
from the earliest extant catalogue, contained in what is known as
the Muratorian Fragment, of which Bp. Westcott says that it
may be regarded as ‘a summary of the opinion of the Western
Chureh on the Canon shortly after the middle of the second
century.' 1 Of the disputed books this contains two Epistles of St.
John, the Apocalypse, and Jude, omitting Hebrews, dames, and
Peter 1, 2. It has been suggested, however, that there is a corrup-
tion in the text, where it now speaks of the Apocalypse of Peter
(Apocalapsc etima Johaomz's ct Petri tantum recipimus quam quidam
ca: nostris legi in ecclesia nolunt), and that the original Greek may
have been something of this sort: καὶ ἡ ἀποκάλυψις δὲ Ἰωάννου
καὶ Πέτρου [ἐπιστολὴ μία, ἣν] μόνην ἀποδεχόμεθα· [ἔστι δὲ καὶ
ἑτέρα] ἤν τινες τῶν ἡμετέρων ἀναγινώσκεσθαι ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ οὐ θέλου-
σιν. Bp. Westcott remarks that the canon of the old Latin version
used by Tertullian corresponds with the Muratorian in omitting the
Epistle of St. James, the second of St. Peter, and Hebrews.2 The
Canon Mommsenianus‚ first published by Th.Mommsen in 1886 from
a MS. of the tenth century, containing the Liber (fenerationis attri-
buted to Hippolytus, appears to belong to the year 359 A.D.‚ and
to have been written in Africa.3 It contains all our canonical books
with the exception of J ames, J ude, and Hebrews 3 but the mention
of the three Epistles of St. John and the two of Peter is followed
by the words uua sola, apparently a correction by an early
