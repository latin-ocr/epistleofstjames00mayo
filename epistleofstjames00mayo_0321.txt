ἰ 21] NOTEs ω

This would seem to make the writer guilty of the absurdity of
supposing a certain amount of malice to be proper for a Christian.
It might be said the same objection applies to the rendering
abundantia ‘ overflowing '‚ because it is the seat of the disease
in the heart, not its manifestation in the words which the Christian
should seek to get rid of. But St. James here speaks as below in ch. iii.
and as our Lord in Mate. xv. 18, 19 of defilement arising from words:
before we can receive the word of God into our hearts we must prepare
the way by laying aside this open outward sin. (2) ‘rank growth‚'
‘ Auswuchs‚' with reference to the ground which has to be prepared for
sowing the seed of the word : so Alf„ Bassett (who translates, clearing
away every kind of ‘rubbish, ῥυπαρία, and overgrowth')‚ Heisen,
Loesner, Pott, comparing Philo M. 2. p. 258 περιτέμνεσθε τὰς σκληρο-
καρδίας, τὸ δέ ἐστι, τὰς περιττὰς φύσεις τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ, ἃς αἱ ἅμετροι τῶν
παθῶν ἔσπειράν τε καὶ συνηύξησαν ὁρμαὶ καὶ ὁ κακὸς ψυχῆς γεωργὸς ἐφύτευ-
σεν, ἀφροσύνη, μετὰ σπουδῆς ἀποκείρασθε. It does not however appear
to be proved that either περισσεία or (still less) ῥυπαρία would bear the
meaning suggested. (3) Hofmann‚ after Gebser and others, takes it
in the sense of ‘ residuum,’ ‘ what is left over and above’ : the Christians
addressed have already renounced sin, but still sin is not entirely
vanquished in them. It is true that περισσεία is not found in this
sense, which would rather require περίσσευμα, but we have περισσός
Exod. X. 5 (the locust) κατέδεται πᾶν τὸ περισσὸν τῆς γῆς, τὸ καταλειφθὲν,
ὃ κατέλιπεν ἡ χάλαζα, Joseph. BJ. ii. 6. 2 (they begged the Romans
to pity) τὰ τῆς Ιουδαίας λείψανα καὶ μὴ τὸ περισσὸν αὐτῆς ἀποῤῥιψαι τοῖς
ὠμῶς σπαράσσουσι, and SO περίσσευμα Mark viii. 8 of the frag-
ments of the loaves. (4) Nothing need be said of the strange inter-
pretation praeputium adopted by Grotius, Hammond and Clericus,
nor of Beza's excrementum = περίττωσις or περίττωμα. Heisen indeed
cites a similar use of περιττεία from Clem. Rom. p. 183 (which I am
unable to verify); but what meaning could κακίας have in connexion
with the word thus understood't Those who take ῥυπαρία with an
independent force understand it of the special sin of uncleanness, but
there does not seem to be any special reference to that sin here, though
there possibly may be in iv. 4, 8 below. Κακία seems best understood
here of malice: cf. Lightfoot on Col. iii. 8 (ἀπόθεσθε ὀργήν, θυμόν,
κακίαν) : ⁴ It is not, at least in the N.T.‚ vice generally, but the vicious
nature which is bent on doing harm to others, and is well described by
Calvin (on Eph. iv. 31) animi pravitas quae humanitati et aequitati est
opposita) He refers to Trench N.T. Synooi. ξ xi. p. 35 seq. It is not
quite correct to say that it always bears this force in the N.T. (cf. Acts
viii. 22, Matt. vi. 34), but here the preceding ὀργή and the following
πραΰτης leave little doubt as to the meaning. [Is it possible that
ῥυπαρία may be used to denote the passively mean and base, in
opposition to κακία, an active form of vice, which leads περισσὰ
πράσσειν 2—0. T.]
