these things, i.e. the suares and temptations of vice, are what render

Butler‘s distinction between the two factors in temptation, the inner
nature and the external circumstances, will help us to understand the
conti-ast apparent in the text between the trial (πειρασμός) in which
the (⁴l1ristian is to rejoice, and the temptation (πειράζεσθαι) which must
not be ascribed to (3011, since from Him only good proceeds. The
latter is the inner temptaffion, the for mer the oute1 trial, and not even

It is the former, the trial by pain, which St. James has in his mind 111
the 21111 verse, and by which those to whom he writes were assailed.

from the rich, as 116 (r 111161 from 1i. (3, v. 7 foll. Τ116) 11616 tempted
to lnur·n1111 against God and to Speak evil of men. St James (below
V. 7— ll) urges upon them the duty of patience, by showing how neces-
sary it is iu common life, by appealing to the example of the prophets,
and pointing to the near approach of the judglnent day, in which
lnurlnuring and inipatience would be punished and the blessedness of
patient suffering he revealed. Here he bids them rejoice in these trying
circumstances, because, if patiently endurcd, they would confirm their
faith and fit them to receive the reward of eternal life promised to all
that love God. It is the sanie inotive which is appealed to in the
Sei-mon on the Mount (Matt. v. 4, 10-12) and in 1 Pet. i. 6 foll.
Another reason for rejoicing in affliction is given in Heb. xii. 6: it is
a mark of God's love towards those whom he chastises. In Acts v. 41
we read that the Apostles, when scourged, rejoiced that they were
count-ed worthy to suffer 511111116 for thc. name of Christ. St. Peter
speaks of the pai-taking of Christ’s suli'erings as a ground for rejoicing
(1 Pet. iv. 123). St. Paul rejoiccd in the thought that he was allowed
to supplement the afflictions of Christ for the sake of the Ohurch
(( 111.1. '4).
