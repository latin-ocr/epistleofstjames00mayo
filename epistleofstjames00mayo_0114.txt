xe THE EPlSTLE OF ST. JAMES

sition were true3 if St. James wrote after St. Paul, must 116
not, with these passages before him, have either attempted to
meet the arguments, it· 116 dissented, or is he agreed with them
(as hc certainly does in ii. 10, 11 and 111 iii. 2), would he not
have avoided the 1156 os phrases such as χωρὶς τῶν ἔρνγων, which
were liable to be misunderstood alike by the followers and the
opponents os the Apostle to the Gentiles?

St. Paul goes on to argue that the blessings promised to Abraham
and all the families of the earth in him, and the covenant made
with Abraham and his seed, are anterior to and irrespective of the
law ; that the Seripture expressly attributes to Abraham a
righteousness‚ not of works, but os saith, and states generally
that ‘the just shall live by saith.’ To these arguments again
no reference is made by St. James, except to the familiar quo-
tation ἐπίστευσεν Ἀβραὰμπῷ θεῷ καὶ ε’λονγίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύ-
νην (James ii. 21, 22), which was probably in common use among
the Jews to prove that orthodoxy of doctrine sufficed for salvation.
His answer is that Abraham's saith proved itself by action, when
he offered Isaac on the altar : if he had not acted thus, he would
not have been accounted righteous, or called the Friend of God.
It is interesting to observe how St. Paul deals with this statement,
to which he distinctly refers in Rom. iv. 2. St. James had said
Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξ ἕρνγων ἐδικαιώθη ,· St. Paul replies
εἰ Γγὰρ Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἕρὙων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα, but this, as he
shows, is inconsistent with the phrase ‘ reckoned sor righteousness,'
which, like the similar phrase 111 Ρ5. xxxii. 1, 2, implies an act os
free grace on the part of God, not a strict legal obligation of
wages earned for work done. His second answer is to replace the
quotation in its original context (Rom. iv. 16—22)‚ as 'spoken of
the birth, not of the sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham's saith in the
promised birth was a settled trust in G0d‚ a long-continued hoping
against hope: it was this posture of mind, not any immediate

action consequent upon it, which was reekoned to him sor ’

righteousness (ἐνεδυναμώθη τῇ πίστει δοὺς· δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ καὶ
πληροφορηθεὶς ὅτι ὃ ἐπήγγελται δυνατός ἐστιν καὶ ποιῆσαι. δ ι ὸ
ἐλοΎίσ θη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην). Neris he content
to leave to the Jews the exclusive boast in the fatherhood os
Abraham (James ii. QU: all who inherit Abraham's saith are sons
of Abraham (Gal. iii. 7, Rom. iv. 12). All this is most apposite in
