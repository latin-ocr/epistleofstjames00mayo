as they are certainly too common, it is better to keep on the safe
side and avoid them altogether. What especially puzzles him is the
(mle omnia. ⁶ Is swearing worse than stealing or adulter-y 2 We must
regard it as a hyperbolical phrase used to add weight to the apostolic
injunctions The truer explanation of the πρὸ πάντων is to limit the
comparison to what immediately precedes St. J ames is not thinking
of offences against the moral law generally, but only of those modes of
expressing impatience of which he had spoken in the preceding verses
μὴ στενάζετε, ἀφ, Cf. 1 Pet. iv. δ’ πρὸ πάντων τὴν εἷς ἑαυτοὺς ἀγαπὴν ἐκτενῆ
ἔχοντας, where this precept is compared with the preceding σωφρονήσατε
καὶ νήψατε, not with the first and great commaudment, ‘Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God.' It must be confessed however that we might
rather have expected the angry feeling of injustice to have expressed
itself in curses than in oathS. The latter seem rather to betoken
irreverence and a low tone as to ordinary truthfuffiess, which would
have come more naturally in speaking of the sins of traders in iv. 13,
cf. Clem. Al. Paed. 3. ξ TO, p. 299 P ἐπαίτιος δὲ ὅρκος περὶ πάντων τοῦ
πωλουμένου ἀπέστω, and Tert. Idol. Χ1. For examples of hasty, ir-
reverent oaths see 1 Sam. xxvi. 16, 2 Kings v. ΖΟ. Still the oath
supplies a heightened form of expression for almost any feeling, and
especially in the case of angry threats, cf. Philo M. 2. p. 271 cited
above. For construction of ὀμνύω cf. Hos. iv. 15 μὴ ὀμνύετε Κύριονι
the acc. is common also in classical writers. Other constructions are
with κατά, εἷς, ἐν. For position of δέ see IndeX av.

where, and in Matt. xxiii. 16 foll„ other common forms of swearing are
specified.

clause ἤτω ἁγνός; 111 Sto-om. vi. 8. p. 778 the same quotation occurs with
ἔστω for ἤτω 111 the first two clauses Hermas (Vis. iii. 3 has μόνον ἡ

polis in Phrygla κατηραμενος ητω αὐτὸς καὶ τὸ, τέκνα αὐτοῦ. He also
gives several examples of the Phrygi an f01m εἵτου. D1. E. L. Hicks ln
a private letter suggests that ‘it was a late form adopted through faelse
analogy from βῆθι βήτω, στῆθι στήτω. The resemblance of ὠ βῶ στῶ,
ἢν ἔβην ἔστην, ἤμεναι βήμεναι might well lead to this.'
